# Version History for FileVista
-------------------------------

## Version 8.9.16 - August 27, 2023

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
    - **Fixed:** In DocumentViewer, no scrollbars were visible for Attachments pane.
    - **Fixed:** In DocumentViewer, remove bottom right grip icon as it overlays over scroll bar bottom arrow.

## Version 8.9.15 - April 24, 2023

  - **Changed:** Compiling source code package now requires Visual Studio 2019 (16.8 update which comes with C# 9.0) (16.0.30709.132) as minimum.
    Requirement for consuming compiled DLLs is NOT changed (VS 2015+).

  - **Improved:** Stability of AssemblyResolver.
    Ensured old log files are cleared, e.g. AssemblyResolver-xx.log and GleamTech-xx.log files.

## Version 8.9.12 - April 16, 2023

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
    - **Added:** Cad formats (.dwg, .dxf, .stl) are now supported with our .netstandard2.0 DLL which means 
      it can be used with .NET Core 2.0+ and .NET 5.0+ projects.

## Version 8.9.11 - April 11, 2023

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
    - **Fixed:** DICOM format (.dcm) with JPEG compression did not work.

## Version 8.9.10 - April 7, 2023

  - **Fixed:** In some cases, root folder quota was not respected, and chunks continued to be uploaded.
    A file that exceeds quota, will be rejected as expected.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
    - **Fixed:** Support for DICOM format (.dcm) was broken. Most files failed with "Index was out of bounds of array" error.
      We also added some features, i.e when converting DICOM files, we also render important DICOM tags on top-left and top-right
      corners of the image.
      Tags displayed on top-left corner: InstitutionName, StudyID, StudyDate, StudyTime, StudyDescription, Modality
      Tags displayed on top-right corner: PatientName, PatientID, PatientBirthDate, PatientSex
    - **Fixed:** DocumentFormat.Dib was mistakenly disabled/commented out so "object null reference error" was raised.
    - **Fixed:** With .NET Framework projects, AzureBlobFileSystem stalled (waited indefinitely) when creating empty files.
      This also caused DocumentCache to stall, as it tries to create empty .sourceName files.

## Version 8.9.8 - April 2, 2023

  - **Improved:** Updated stability of GleamTech.FileUltimate, GleamTech.DocumentUltimate, GleamTech.ImageUltimate, GleamTech.VideoUltimate and GleamTech.Common.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
    - Updated jquery to latest 3.6.4 and jquery-ui to latest 1.13.2 for document viewer and ensured CSS is scoped.
    - Some type changes will trigger a cache migration as in v8.9.5 so be patient when you first open a document:
      With this version, DocumentCache will migrate this change automatically for you, it will scan the cache folder,
      update all .json cache info files, regenerate cache keys (due to json serialization change) and rename cache files to match the new cache keys.
      This migration will be run on first access to the cache, it can take few seconds to complete (may take longer for cloud folders).
      You can check the details and results of the migration in CacheMigrate.log in cache folder.

## Version 8.9.6 - March 7, 2023

  - **Fixed:** Video thumbnails failed on older supported OS, i.e. Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and Windows 7 SP1.

  - **Fixed:** FileCache did not append to the existing log files (CacheTrim and CacheMigrate) correctly.

## Version 8.9.5 - February 23, 2023

  - **Changed:** .NET Framework target is changed from net461 to net472.
    So from now on, you need to have a .NET Framework 4.7.2 or above project to reference our .NET Framework DLL (not related to our .netstandard2.0 DLL).
    Minimum supported development environment version is changed from Visual Studio 2012 to Visual Studio 2015 (first to support net472 targeting pack).
    Minimum supported deployment server OS is still Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (first to support net472 runtime).
    Minimum supported deployment client OS is still Windows 7 SP1 (first to support net472 runtime).

  - **Improved:** FileCache will now log information and errors about trimming and migrating.
    - Migration related details and errors will be logged to CacheMigrate.log in cache folder (and important one also to GleamTech.log).
    - Trimming related details and errors will be logged to CacheTrim.log in cache folder (and important one also to GleamTech.log).
    - Updated cache versioning, CacheVersion's first 2 parts are FileCache version, second 2 parts are sub-class cache version.
      e.g. 2.0.1.0 -> FileCache, 2.0.2.0 -> DocumentCache, 2.0.3.0 -> ThumbnailCache.
    - Improved migration handling (especially in FileCache sublasses) and stability.

  - **Changed:** GleamTechConfiguration.LogEnabled property -> The default value is now true.
    GleamTech.log can be found under the temporary folder (default is "App_Data\Temporary").

  - **Changed:** Thumbnail cache subfolder under temporary folder will be renamed: "ImageCache" -> "ThumbnailCache"

  - **Improved:** Updated installer:
    - .NET Framework 4.7.2 runtime will be downloaded and installed automatically (via web installer) on required machines (restart required).
    - SHA-2 Code Signing Support Updates (KB3033929, KB4490628, KB4474419) will be installed
      on Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and Windows 7 SP1 because .NET Framework Installer fails witout these updates on old machines (restart required 2 times).

## Version 8.9.3 - January 9, 2023

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Improved:** Stability and performance of Cad formats.

  - **Improved:** Stability and performance of video thumbnails.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer. 

## Version 8.9.2 - August 14, 2022

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Improved:** Stability and performance of WordProcessing, Spreadsheet and ProjectManagement formats.

  - **Improved:** Stability and performance of image thumbnails, image viewer and video thumbnails.

  - **Improved:** Updated embedded database engine to improve stability and performance. 

  - **Improved:** Updated installer. 

## Version 8.9.0 - June 24, 2022

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Improved:** Stability and performance of WordProcessing, Spreadsheet, Presentation and Cad formats.

  - **Improved:** Stability and performance of image thumbnails, image viewer.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer. 

## Version 8.8.9 - June 3, 2022

  - **Improved:** Stability of FileUploader. Upload queue and events will be handled better.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer. 

## Version 8.8.8 - May 11, 2022

  - **Improved:** Stability of file systems:
    - PhysicalFileSystem: Parent folder should be automatically created with CreateFile, CreateLock, CopyFile, MoveFile like cloud file systems.
    - AzureBlobFileSystem and for some remaining cases in AmazonS3FileSystem: Parent should not disappear if empty (if no entries left) 
      after RenameFile, RenameFolder, MoveFile, DeleteFile, DeleteFolder.
    - AmazonS3FileSystem: Fixed copy or move across regions.
    - AzureBlobFileSystem: Ensured the copy is actually completed.
    - AzureBlobFileSystem and AmazonS3FileSystem: Both AzureBlob and AmazonS3 does not allow changing lastModified property
      of an object once uploaded so added custom metadata "DateCreated", "DateAccessed", "DateModified" for storing original date-times.
      This way uploaded files will keep original last modified date (e.g. the date from physical file system).
      These original date-times will be used for listing files in AzureBlob, but in AmazonS3 it can only be used when accessing file individiually.
    - AmazonS3FileSystem and for some remaining cases in AzureBlobFileSystem: Ensured ContentType is always updated.

## Version 8.8.6 - April 27, 2022

  - **Changed:** In Web.config by default, the HTTP Headers "Content-Security-Policy", "X-Frame-Options", "X-XSS-Protection" 
    will be removed so that these headers are not inherited from IIS root/machine level which cause confusion when some features
    in FileVista does not work like iframes in popup windows being blocked and browsers do not give a clue of what's happening.
    These headers should be opt-in.

  - **Added:** CSP (content security policy) errors will be shown to make troubleshooting easier.
    Made use of browser's SecurityPolicyViolation event, note that iframe blocking errors cannot be caught.
    Alert will be shown only for different violatedDirectives, message looks like this:
      Some part of the component was not rendered/loaded due to a restrictive CSP directive. 
      Please check and fix your 'Content-Security-Policy' HTTP Header or HTML meta element on this page.
      CSP Report: ...

  - **Fixed:** On Firefox, if a PDF file was opened with browser's own PDF Viewer, the window was closed after 3 seconds 
    as the window was wrongly detected as an empty window. Also the window for XML files, will be kept open on all browsers.

  - **Fixed:** FileUploader sometimes added wrong number of files (e.g. when dragged and dropped 88 files, FileUploader showed 86 files). 
    This was caused by collision of generated unique IDs for files and duplicates were being filtered out.

  - **Fixed:** FileUploader sometimes failed starting upload in Details layout mode due to an UI error.

## Version 8.8.5 - April 20, 2022

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Added:** Nested attachments are now supported for Email and Pdf formats.
      - Attachments will use the same PdfOutputOptions.Watermarks and PdfOutputOptions.FastWebViewEnabled properties   
        from root container document for PDFs generated for attachments.
      - Some emails may contain extensionless attachments which are nested emails, these are "message/rfc822" attachments.
        Now .eml extension will be added to these attachments so that they can be converted and displayed in DocumentViewer.

    - **Improved:** DocumentViewer UI:
      - Tabs on the left side pane will be activated on document load, automatically according to this priority (from lowest to highest):
        - If there are bookmarks, Bookmarks tab will be activated.
        - If there are attachments, Attachments tab will be activated.
        - If there is a search term, Search tab will be activated.
      - Fixed text-wrapping in Bookmarks and Attachments tree panels for better width and look.
      - In attachment tree nodes, file size will not be displayed next to file name (it's already displayed on the attachment tooltip).
      - On attachment tooltips, desciption will shown as "DispositionType (ContentType)" e.g "attachment (application/octet-stream)".
      - On attachment tooltips, the last modified date will also be shown (for PDF Portfolio and Email attachments when available).

  - **Improved:** Stability and performance of image thumbnails, image viewer and video thumbnails.

  - **Fixed:** Since previous version, AmazonS3 file system was broken for net461 target with error "Error unmarshalling response back...".

## Version 8.8.0 - March 13, 2022

  - **Improved:** Updated embedded database engine to improve stability and performance. 

  - **Improved:** Stability and performance of image thumbnails, image viewer and video thumbnails.

## Version 8.7.0 - March 5, 2022

  - **Changed:** .NET Framework target is changed from 4.0 to 4.6.1.
    So from now on, you need to have .NET Framework 4.6.1 or above runtime on your server to run FileVista.
    Minimum supported deployment server OS is changed from Windows Server 2003 R2 to Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (first to support net461 runtime).
    Minimum supported deployment client OS is changed from Windows Vista to Windows 7 SP1 (first to support net461 runtime).

  - **Improved:** Updated installer:

    - Renamed installer FileVista-vX.X.X.X.exe to FileVistaSetup.exe (no version in exe name, the container zip package already has version in name)
      However, the version will be displayed on all pages of Installer UI at top right.

    - Prerequisites will be downloaded and installed only after user confirms on the Installer UI (not directly on launch).

    - .NET Framework 4.6.1 runtime will be downloaded and installed automatically on required machines (restart required).

    - Improved Windows Features (IIS) package. Additionally, Basic, Digest and Windows Authentication features for IIS will be enabled.
      Package is versioned now and it will not be launched every time if it was installed once.
      Note that this means if you disable Windows Features (or Web Server Roles) manually, this package will not enable them again (unless package version is newer).

    - For updates, installer will now automatically pre-select the virtual directory with the already installed FileVista instance 
      and mark with "(Installed)" text in the Web Site/Virtual Directory list to prevent confusion.
      You can still select a different virtual directory when updating with Installer.
      Also installer will mark virtual directories with other FileVista instances that were installed manually (checks some FileVista files), 
      with "(Instance Found)" text in the list, in case you may want to update that instance with Installer.

    - In some rare cases, Web Site/Virtual Directory list would appear empty due to duplicate entries in IIS metadata, now duplicates
      will be ignored.

    - Left overs from old installations (""FileVista X.X.X.X"" folders) in %APPDATA%\GleamTech (C:\Users\USER1\AppData\Roaming) will be cleaned up.
      New Installer will use a neater folder structure (SetupFiles\, Prerequisites\, Setup.log) in  %APPDATA%\GleamTech\FileVista 
      and always cleanup extracted files.

    - Installer will create desktop and program menu shortcuts for easily accessing FileVista on your server.
      This is an URL shortcut which simply opens your browser with the url that is built from host name and virtual directory that were
      determined during installation (usually http://localhost/FileVista/). For example if you change your WebSite's binding settings 
      in IIS manually in future (e.g. no localhost) then you will need to update those shortcuts accordingly.

## Version 8.6.0 - February 22, 2022

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Fixed:** First page gray issue if "Background graphics" option is selected on Chrome's print preview dialog.

    - **Fixed:** Incorrect ligatures for Persian Farsi when converting PPTX to PDF.

    - **Improved:** Stability and performance of Portable, WordProcessing, Spreadsheet, Presentation and Email formats.

  - **Improved:** Stability and performance of image thumbnails, image viewer and video thumbnails.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer. 

## Version 8.5.0 - November 29, 2021

  - **Added:** New icons for most file extensions, e.g. latest icons from Windows 11 and Office 2021.

  - **Improved:** More relax drag and drop for preventing confusion for users, i.e. even if user drags over regular files
    (e.g. not subfolder and not container files like .zip), the parent folder will be considered as the drop target (similar 
    behaviour to Windows Explorer). This works for both internal drag&drop and upload drag&drop. This is especially useful when
    user is using "Details" view layout where there is not enough white space.

  - **Improved:** When using drag and drop, keyboard shortcuts will be displayed to the user as labels e.g. "Hold down SHIFT to move", 
    "Hold down CTRL to copy" and "Press ESC to cancel". Many users may not be aware of these useful keyboard shortcuts.

  - **Fixed:** Missing placeholders in Swedish and Arabic language files.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player:

    - PIP (Picture in Picture) support.

    - Updated background images to new FullHD images for both audio and video modes.

    - Minimum player size is increased to 448x252 (HD Video 16:9 ratio) so that video info shown at the end, fits the player.

## Version 8.3.7 - May 26, 2021

  - **Improved:** FileUploader:
    
    - **Improved:** MessageBox opened by FileUploader -> "View info" will display maxRequestSize instead of 
      maxUploadAsBinarySize, maxUploadAsFormSize in "Server features" for less confusion.

    - **Improved:** In Web.config, <location path="fileuploader.ashx"> will be used again instead of <location path="fileuploader.ashx/UploadAsBinary"> 
      and <location path="fileuploader.ashx/UploadAsBinary"> for less confusion and also because older machines (lower than .NET 4.5) may not
      understand /UploadAsBinary or /UploadAsForm part in path for httpRuntime.

    - **Improved:** Ensured upload queue is always stopped for unrecoverable errors, e.g. for connection error (offline error).

  - **Improved:** Better error messages for connection (XHR) errors (e.g. offline error) in FileUploader and FileManager.
    Better error handling for late coming responses, to prevent UI update related errors when component was already destroyed.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
  
    - **Improved:** Stability, performance for WordProcessing and Spreadsheet formats.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer. 

## Version 8.3.6 - April 28, 2021

  - **Fixed:** Since v8.3.0, when running under server runtime lower than .NET 4.5 version (old servers)
    FileUploader showed "Maximum request length exceeded." for files bigger than 4MB in old browsers like IE9 (Html4 mode).
    Added an additional setting in Web.config to support old servers out of the box again.

  - **Fixed:** MessageBox opened by FileUploader -> "View info" was displaying html encoded message where it shouldn't since v8.3.5.

  - **Added:** MessageBox opened by FileUploader -> "View info" will now display more info, i.e.
    "Server features" (maxUploadAsBinarySize, maxUploadAsFormSize, chunkSize)
    and "User restrictions" (allowedMaxFileSize, allowedFileTypes, deniedFileTypes).

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
  
    - **Fixed:** DocumentViewer threw below error intermittently on some machines when using physical file system for cache:
      "Access to the path "[DocumentCache]:\lock-****.json.lock" is denied due to insufficient permissions."
      The error was not really a permission error but a multi-thread file access error.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer. 

## Version 8.3.5 - April 18, 2021

  - **Improved:** Names will be html encoded everywhere to prevent possible XSS issues and show proper file names like "File\&gt;Test"
    instead of "File>Test". In MultiView, MessageBox title/message/conflict dialog, Window title, Breadcrumb buttons and menus, 
    Folder Tree, MediaPlayer file info, ImageViewer bottom title, DocumentViewer.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
  
    - **Improved:** Stability, performance for Portable formats.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer. 

## Version 8.3.1 - March 23, 2021

  - **Improved:** The installer will not show "Install to subfolder" checkbox when upgrading an existing installation to prevent confusion.
    Forgetting to uncheck it, resulted in a nested FileVista folder which caused IIS Web.config error.
    If you had this problem with the older installers, you can fix the corrupted upgrade like this:
    1.	Go to IIS Manager and find FileVista application under the parent web site.
    2.	Right click on that, select Delete (which will delete the IIS Application not the actual folder)
    3.	Refresh the parent web site, if you don’t see FileVista folder with regular folder icon (e.g. a folder icon with a shortcut symbol)
        Repeat step 2, this time you will be deleting the IIS Virtual Directory.
    4.	Refresh the parent web site and you should see FileVista folder with regular folder icon.
        Right click on it and click "Convert To Application".
        In the opened dialog, select existing "FileVista" for ApplicationPool field and click OK.
    5.  Finally in File Explorer, ensure you only have "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\FileVista" and not a nested folder "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\FileVista\FileVista".
    
  - **Fixed:** "Add to zip" action displayed "Could not find file" error even if the zip was correctly generated.
    The problem probably started happening with v8.3.0 (after improvements to ArchiveFileSystem).

  - **Fixed:** GleamTechWebConfiguration.LocklessSessionFixEnabled property which was added back in v7.9.0, caused early session timeout
    issue (e.g. 2 minutes) in the host application. The default property is now changed from true to false for preventing the issue.
    Note that this only effected ASP.NET Classic applications but not ASP.NET Core applications.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Fixed:** Duplicate file names will now be allowed in PDF Portfolio because surprisingly there are people who add attachments
      with duplicate names to an email. For example if there are 2 attachments named "test.pdf", the second one will be renamed to "test (2).pdf".
      DocumentViewer will no longer display error "PDF already contains an embedded file named ..." for emails with duplicate attachments.

## Version 8.3.0 - February 16, 2021

  - **Improved:** Stability, performance for FileManager and FileUploader.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Improved:** Stability, performance for Portable formats.

    - **Fixed:** Prevent unnecessary error in some cases:
      'attachments' parameter is unexpectedly null or undefined.

## Version 8.2.5 - January 1, 2021

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer. 

  - **Changed:** Source code package did not include source of GleamTech.Common project since v7.34.0.
    From now on, it will be included again.

## Version 8.2.1 - November 23, 2020

  - **Added:** Cookieless session will be used when necessary to automatically fix session issues, i.e. when the browser 
    does not allow cookies via browser settings or via iframe with a cross-domain URL.
    The cookieless session will be established via headers, form or querystring where possible.

    Added GleamTechWebConfiguration.AutoCookielessSessionEnabled property to control this feature (default value is true). 
    You don't need to use GleamTechWebConfiguration.CookieSameSiteFixEnabled when this property is true.

  - **Fixed:** When <sessionState cookieless="true" /> was set in Web.config, the below error was being thrown:
    'Invalid method request: Method with name "" not found'

## Version 8.2.0 - November 17, 2020

  - **Fixed:** The Location field of RootFolder was still being truncated to 255 characters, 
    although in database it was increased to 500 characters back in v6.7.

  - **Improved:** For Azure file system, correct content type will be set for files that are uploaded.
    In previous versions content type was not set so Azure Blob by default used "application/octet-stream" for all uploaded files.
    This made complications for external usage of uploaded files from Azure Blob. 
    For example when using an Azure Blob URL in a web page, it should be have the right content type, 
    e.g. for png image, content type should be "image/png", so that the browser shows it immediately as image 
    (not download it to users computer, as when Blob was content type of "application/octet-stream"). 

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Fixed:** Viewing email formats with a zero-sized attachment failed with "Index was outside the bounds of the array. " error.

    - **Improved:** Updated Danish, Swedish and Norwegian translation files.

  - **Changed:** Logo on login page from "keys" logo to FileVista logo.

## Version 8.1.6 - November 9, 2020

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Fixed:** In some browsers, DocumentViewer was shown as grey box and "originalConfig is not defined..." error was logged in the console.
      This was caused by web security software such as "Webroot Filtering Extension" which blocked iframe communication in some cases.

    - **Fixed:** Attachment names with unicode characters (e.g. german umlauts) were not encoded correctly when generating PDF Portfolio.
      This caused DocumentViewer to show names with garbage characters in the Attachments tab for an email file.

    - **Improved:** "Download" and "Download as PDF" buttons will now download the currently selected attachment, not the container document.

    - **Improved:** Updated German translation file.

## Version 8.1.5 - November 3, 2020

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Added:** PDF Portfolio (aka PDF Package) support. DocumentViewer can now display PDF files with embedded files (attachments).
      DocumentViewer will show tree of attachments on the left side and it's now possible to click attachments to load and display.
      Subfolders for attachments are also supported.
      If the PDF Portfolio has Adobe's default placeholder page (cover sheet with "For the best experience...." text), it will be replaced by
      DocumentUltimate's cover sheet which includes useful information such as list of attachments in the file.

    - **Added:** Attachments inside email formats (MSG, EML) will now be available in DocumentViewer. 
      Email formats with attachments will generate a PDF Portfolio (aka PDF Package).
      DocumentViewer will show tree of attachments on the left side and it's now possible to click attachments to load and display.
      The cover sheet will be the email message itself.

    - **Improved:** Stability, accuracy for Presentation formats.

      - Fixed "LoadBrushElementData:ignorePressure" error for some PPTX file.

      - Fixed "The type initializer for '_foB' threw an exception." error for Presentation formats on some machines.

    - **Added:** Danish, Swedish and Norwegian translations.

    - **Improved:** To reduce memory usage for some intermediate conversions for DocumentConverter, created TemporaryInputOutputHandler 
      (which uses temporary files) and used it instead of MemoryInputOutputHandler (e.g. for PostApply PDF and for email -> mht -> pdf).

    - **Improved:** Blank page at the end will be prevented for some conversions (especially for email -> mht -> pdf)
      We remove last empty paragraphs (no text and no image) to prevent blank page when converting to a fixed page format like pdf, images etc (eg. not docx).

    - **Improved:** Optimized DocumentViewer client-side stability and performance.

## Version 8.1.0 - September 15, 2020

  - **Fixed:** After upgrading from an older version like 6.5, old public links failed with "Link not found" error on some servers.

  - **Fixed:** "Session has expired..." confirmation was not shown for Download, DownloadAsZip, Preview actions (the page was refreshed 
    without asking). Optimized DownloadError.html and SessionExpired.html for better debug information.

  - **Improved:** Optimized iOS support:

    - As iOS 13+ can download files (has download manager), Download action will not need to open file in current window for iOS 13+ (browser
      will show download/view confirmation).

    - Long-press (tap-hold) will open context menus in FileManager and FileUploader. Longpress also works on non-touch devices like desktop browsers.

    - When long-pressing on thumbnails, the browser's callout will be prevented.

  - **Fixed:** When a root folder with PhysicalLocation had credentials, "access denied" error was shown on 100 percent even if the file was actually
    uploaded (impersonation was lost when setting DateModified).

## Version 8.0.18 - August 31, 2020

  - **Fixed:** A minor security issue.

  - **Fixed:** Since v8.0.12, due to a security fix, viewing root folders or subfolders with names including some special characters caused an error.

  - **Fixed:** Dropping a folder to itself, the folder disappeared on Azure file system (and strange behaviour on other file systems).
    "The destination folder X is a subfolder of the source folder Y" error will be shown as expected (it was broken).

  - **Improved:** Center pane (MultiView) sometimes was not displaying thumbnails for some items (e.g when resizing the browser and then
    refreshing the folder). Improved CSS of MultiView so that it will be easier to override background color.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer. 

## Version 8.0.15 - August 17, 2020

  - **Fixed:** "Add file..." button on FileUploader was not clickable on iOS and Android browsers when user switched to "Request Desktop WebSite" mode.

  - **Fixed:** When sorting columns or starting upload, items disappeared from view in FileUploader on iOS browsers.

  - **Improved:** Child windows including FileUploader on phones will now fit in the small screen.
    FileUploader bottom toolbar will be scrollable on small sizes.
    Navigation pane and ribbon pane are now responsive, they will collapse when "screen width < 500" and "screen height < 500" respectively.

  - **Improved:** Better column resizing in "Details" view layout.
    On first render, columns will fit in the available space but then user can freely resize a column, i.e overflowing the available space
    will be allowed and the remaining columns will keep their size.

  - **Fixed:** Minimized child windows were not aligned correctly at the bottom, after one of them was closed and then the parent was resized.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Fixed:** When viewing Email formats (.eml, .msg), unnecessary "PageHeader:" header was rendered at the top.

## Version 8.0.12 - August 6, 2020

  - **Fixed:** A minor security issue.

  - **Added:** Persian translation. 

  - **Improved:** Updated French translation.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Added:** Italian and Polish translations. 

    - **Improved:** Updated Russian translation.

    - **Improved:** Stability, performance for Email formats.

## Version 8.0.10 - July 10, 2020

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Fixed:** When viewing or converting Email formats (.eml, .msg), message body with large tables did not fit on page.

    - **Improved:** DocumentViewer rendering accuracy and performance.

    - **Improved:** Stability, performance for Portable formats.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

## Version 8.0.9 - June 29, 2020

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Fixed:** When viewing Email formats (.eml, .msg), message body with large inline images did not fit on page.
      Also timezone relative to UTC/GMT will be diplayed on "Sent" header field (e.g. UTC+03:00) for more clarity on server time (which did the conversion).

    - **Fixed:** Could not load some ProjectManagement files (.mpp). MPX files can be viewed.

    - **Improved:** Stability, performance for Diagram formats.

## Version 8.0.8 - June 23, 2020

  - **Added:** "File Extensions" checkbox to "View" ribbon tab of FileManager which can be useful to toggle showing of file extensions on the fly.
    This behaviour is normally controlled in "Application Settings" but now it can also be toggled directly in FileManager UI.

  - **Improved:** FileUploadeder did not inherit some properties like showFileExtensions and viewCheckboxSelection from its owner FileManager.
    Now whenever you re-open FileUploader, it will reflect those changed properties from FileManager.

  - **Fixed:** When using a physical root folder with AuthenticatedUser=Windows, intermittent "the handle is invalid" error occured while 
    trying to impersonate before accessing PhysicalFileSystem. This happened because the access token retrieved from WindowsIdentity
    was not duplicated and when owner WindowsIdentity went out of scope (garbage collected), its access token was also being disposed.

  - **Fixed:** "Import Users" dialog was not visually listing users when clicked on "Find All" due to a JS error (although the users were being
    sucessfully retrieved). 
    Added tooltips so that long text in columnns and error details can be seen easily.
    When a user import fails "Import result" column will contain more details.
    Prevented error when "Full name" or "Description" columns had long characters (max is 50 and 100 chars respectively).
    These non-vital columns will be truncated when there are more characters than these limits.
    Note that Name and Email columns will still throw error if longer than 50 characters as they cannot be truncated (vital fields)

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
  
    - **Fixed:** In mobile viewer, "Cannot delete annotations..." error occured when pressing backspace or del keys inside search field.

    - **Improved:** Perfected paddings in left side pane and no more unnessary horizontal scrollbar on IE and Edge.

## Version 8.0.5 - June 15, 2020

  - **Improved:** Child windows will always maximize to browser's viewport instead of parent component.
    Minimized windows will be stacked also vertically when they do not fit parent component's width.
    Ensured minimized windows are aligned and sized correctly after parent component is hidden and then shown.

  - **Improved:** Increased the default timeout for component actions (both client and server side) to 1 hour.
    For example deleting a huge folder from Azure file system can take long.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
  
    - **Improved:** Removed unnecessary paddings and borders in left side pane and when notes panel is hidden, on the right side 20px 
      placeholder should not be visible.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

## Version 8.0.2 - June 3, 2020

  - **Improved:** FileManager will generate higher quality thumbnails (without artifacts) for image files containing an EXIF thumbnail in 
    "Large icons", "Medium icons" and "Tiles" view layouts. Note that this does not effect "Extra large icons" view layout or images without
    an EXIF thumbnail, because in those cases, higher quality thumbnails were already generated.

  - **Added:** Better child window management. Minimized windows will be stacked neatly at the bottom like a taskbar (no more on top of each other).
    Ensured position and size for minimized, restored, maximized states are always correct (e.g. when parent component is resized).
    Tooltips for long titles on minimized windows.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Fixed:** Auto exif orientation for multi-page TIFFs, only first frame was being rotated.

    - **Improved:** Stability, performance for conversion of raster image files to Portable formats.

## Version 8.0.0 - May 22, 2020

  - **Changed:** License keys are changed so please go to https://www.gleamtech.com/upgrade and acquire a new license 
    key if you want to use this version (or higher). If your one year maintenance has not ended, you will receive a 
    new free license key on the same page. 

  - **Added:** New "Application Title" setting in "Application Settings" for changing default title "FileVista" shown on login and other pages.

  - **Improved:** New UI for header (top bar) on main page. Planning to update UI for administration panel on next versions.

  - **Fixed:** Slow login in some cases due to SQL query for root folder's access controls running slow (or execution timeout error).

  - **Improved:** Media Player:

    - "Details" tab will be shown on "Media Format Error" dialog for more details on why the video could not be played.
      Also an error dialog will be shown on other errors (e.g. no internet connection).

    - Perfected the player UI (e.g. time slider colors and knob size).

    - Added playback speed control.

    - Added m3u, m3u8, hls stream support (Not working on Chrome, only on Edge and probably on Apple browsers)

    - Added title (file name) and description (same columns as multiview tooltips)

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
   
    - **Improved:** Stability, accuracy for Portable and Spreadsheet formats.

  - **Improved**: Updated turkish language file.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer. 

## Version 7.36.0 - January 24, 2020

  - **Fixed:** After updating to 7.35.5 and running you may have received an error due to invalid value in database ("KB" for MaxZipFileSize in Setting table).
  
  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Fixed:** Viewing some files (or converting when hosted on IIS) caused StackOverflowException. The viewer would only show  "Status: error"
      message without details as it was not possible to catch this exception. This was expecially reproducable for PDFs with signed certificates.
      IIS (also IIS Express) reduces the regular 1 MB stacksize to 512KB (and to 256 KB on 32-bit w3wp.exe) and this caused some conversions to 
      fail with this exception. 
      This is now prevented. If current thread's stack size is lower than the required stack size, a new thread will be created with the required
      stack size and the conversion will be done inside this thread to prevent StackOverflowException.

    - **Improved:** DocumentCache will from now on consider zero-sized cached files as not existing because they are usually left overs from failed 
      old cache attempts. For example some exceptions are not catch-able like StackOverflowException so sometimes it may not be possible to cleanup
      a newly created zero-sized cache file before the process exists.
      This will prevent "Downloading file part error occured and could not get the reason." error when a conversion was not working before but
      it was fixed later (a zero-sized cached file will trigger a re-conversion).

  - **Improved:** New product icon for installer and new favicon for web application. Also made sure favicon is loaded even if FileVista is
    installed to a subdirectory (e.g. contoso.com/filevista).

  - **Improved:** Updated installer. 

## Version 7.35.5 - January 9, 2020

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Added:** Support for viewing STL File Format (3D Printing).

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer.

## Version 7.35.1 - November 27, 2019

  - **Fixed:** File Uploader's "Add files" button was broken on iOS and Android (clicking did nothing) since 7.32.0 (since new uploader).

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Fixed:** Some PDFs with annotations failed to load, i.e appeared loading indefinitely, but actually an error was thrown in the console:
      "Unsupported XPZ document element type"

## Version 7.35.0 - November 20, 2019

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
  
    - **Fixed:** When viewing Spreadsheet formats, the original headers and footers were being emptied.

  - **Improved:** AmazonS3 root folders should now support IAM roles when location's AccessKeyId property is not specified, i.e.
    the credentials should be loaded from the Instance Profile service on an EC2 instance.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer.

## Version 7.34.7 - November 18, 2019

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Fixed:** For net40 DLL, conversion from diagram formats failed when loading from stream, so also viewer could not open diagram formats.

  - **Improved:** Accuracy of video thumbnails for some files.

## Version 7.34.5 - November 13, 2019

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Fixed:** Fonts of the document were not being loaded on IE and Edge so the document did not look like the original (probably since 4.8.0).

## Version 7.34.0 - October 31, 2019

  - **Changed:** For building source code package, from now on Visual Studio 2017+ (15.3+) is required (due to new sdk-style project 
    files for supporting multiple target frameworks). Note that this is not related to consuming binaries, they still support 
    Visual Studio 2010+. This info is only for "Source License" owners.

## Version 7.33.5 - October 12, 2019

  - **Fixed:** "Rename file" action caused an error. "Move folder" action did not work correctly.

  - **Fixed:** update.aspx was not shown (configuration.aspx was shown) when updating from versions older than v7.2.0 because 
    old FileVista.config file format was not recognized.

## Version 7.33.0 - September 12, 2019

  - **Fixed:** Deleting connection string from FileVista.config (or putting it back) was not being caught by file change monitor.
    This effected a step of manual DB migration procedure which needs the Configuration.aspx to display.

  - **Improved:** FileUploader will now set last modified date of the uploaded file if target file system supports it (and client sends it).

  - **Improved:** Performance and stability for zip feature:

    - The files generated by "Add to Zip" and "Download as Zip" actions will now include 3 file dates for folders because from now on,
      redundant folder entries will not be removed like in previous versions. Dates are UTC but fallbacks to non-utc lastmodified for 
      old zip clients.

    - For entry names, zip spec default IBM (OEM) Code Page 437 encoding will be used for main header but with an extra UTF8 FileName
      (and UTF8 Comment) header for zip clients that support it (e.g. Windows 8+ Explorer, 7zip, Winzip). 
      In previous versions, UTF8 encoding was used for main header when necessary (if filename had unicode characters) but this caused
      old zip clients like "Windows 7 Explorer" to show mangled file names as they expect to read in zip spec default Code Page 437 for 
      main header. While using Code Page 437, unicode characters  will be also replaced with "_" instead of "?" character so in old zip
      clients like "Windows 7 Explorer" can at least display and extract files (it hides filenames with "?" character as it's an illegal
      character for filenames on Windows). Note that "Windows 8 Explorer" and above already support extra UTF8 headers.

    - We aimed maxium compatiblity for generated zip files, if you notice a strange problem let us know.
    
  - **Improved:** Performance and stability for file systems:

    - ArchiveFileSystem now supports reading TarLZip (tar.lz, tlz) and TarXz (tar.xz, txz) archive formats.

    - Create and update nested zips without errors on all file systems.

    - Unified common errors for all file systems.

  - **Improved:** Handling of temporary files ("Temporary file location" setting will now use the new GleamTechConfiguration.TemporaryFolder
    property for unifying all temp folders):

      - New property GleamTechConfiguration.TemporaryFolder for being able to use a different folder than the default system temporary 
      folder. All GleamTech products will use the same folder (removed FileUltimateConfiguration.TemporaryPath property).
      When you change this property, some default folders for products will change automatically if they are subfolders of TemporaryFolder.
      You can set this property to have more control on temporary folder (adjusting permissions, observing size etc.). 
      For example for web apps, you can set it to "~/App_Data/Temporary" to observe it more easily.

    - Under temporary folder, there will be no more subfolders for the products but there will be subfolders for the feature:

      "GleamTech.Core" -> "ResourceCache"
      "FileUltimate\ImageCache" -> "ImageCache"
      "FileUltimate\DocumentCache" -> "DocumentCache"
      "FileUltimate" -> removed
      "DocumentUltimate" -> removed
      "ImageUltimate" -> removed

      The old subfolders will be migrated automatically.

    - When accessing TemporaryFolder, detailed "Access Denied" error messages will be shown to troubleshoot insufficent 
      permission issues. The error message will include the safe display path and current windows identity (and impersonation level).

    - Changed the default value of GleamTechConfiguration.LogFile property from "~/App_Data/GleamTech.log" to 
      "[GleamTechConfiguration.TemporaryFolder]\GleamTech.log".

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer.

  - **Improved:** Updated embedded database engine. 

## Version 7.32.6 - August 8, 2019

  - **Improved:** Impersonation level (if available) will also be displayed in "Access Denied" error messages and 
    in "Current Identity" fields of some dialogs (e.g. "Domain\User (Impersonation)") for better troubleshooting insufficent permission issues.

## Version 7.32.5 - August 6, 2019

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
  
    - **Improved:** DocumentViewer rendering accuracy and performance. Improved DocumentViewer JS loading 
      and initialization speed in browser. Updated jQuery to the latest safe version to prevent warnings.

    - **Fixed:** Old browser support (e.g. IE 9) was broken due to some JS errors.

  - **Improved:** Detailed "Access Denied" error messages will be shown to troubleshoot insufficent permission issues.
    The error message will include the safe display path and current windows identity.

## Version 7.32.0 - July 11, 2019

  - **Added:** New uploader which is rewritten from scratch:

    - Modernized UI which now includes MultiView with "Details" and "LargeIcons" view layout modes (like in FileManager).
      Displaying thumbnails of added files before uploading is now possible. Client-side thumbnails can be generated only for
      .png and .jpg files for now.

    - Better dialogs for "Add Conflict" and "Upload Conflict" which have a MultiView for listing the conflicting items with 
      details (even thumbnails).

  - **Improved:** Delete action in FileManager now displays a better dialog which have a MultiView for listing the items to be deleted
    with details (even thumbnails).

  - **Changed:** Language xml file format; entries are now grouped inside <EntryGroup> element and missing translations are now  
    indicated with <Value>{NotTranslated}</Value> for easy lookup in the language file.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer.

## Version 7.30.2 - April 4, 2019

  - **Improved:** Stability for the new upload feature:

    - **Fixed:**" Add" button on "Upload Window" was broken (only drag and drop worked).

    - **Fixed:**" Empty (zero-sized) files were not being added and thus not uploaded.

    - **Fixed:**" Html4 upload method was broken (upload failed).

    - **Improved:** The target folder in the background will be refreshed only after the all files in the queue are uploaded
      and not after each file is uploaded. This will prevent unnecessary server calls and UI flickering. After uploading
      subfolders, they will be also be selected now just like files after refresh.

    - **Added:** Changed "Add..." button to "Add Files" and added "Add Folders" button next to it. 
       On supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox), you can directly add folders via this new button (alternative to drag and drop).
       Due to browser implementations, we need a second button, i.e. browser's picker dialog can only select files or folders
       but not both at the same time.

## Version 7.30.0 - April 2, 2019

  - **Added:** It's now possible to drag and drop files and folders from desktop (or file system) directly to FileManager.
    This means you no longer need to open "Upload Files" window first to drop and upload. It works same as internal drag and drop,
    i.e. you can drag and drop to any folder (or zip file) UI item you see in the FileManager. For example dragging and holding 
    on a folder node in the folder tree (left pane) will expand the folder node so you can drill down before dropping.
    While dragging, "Upload to <folder>" indicator will display below the cursor to let you know where you are exactly uploading to
    (subfolder name or not allowed indicator). 
    Dropping folders is supported on recent browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and IE10+ supports only dropping files but not folders
    (a warning message is displayed when you drop a folder on IE).
    Regular "Upload Files" window also supports dropping folders on supported browsers now.

  - **Fixed:** Drag selecting items in FileManager via right mouse button, was not working as in older versions, only 
    primary (left) mouse button was working. 

  - **Fixed:** Some UI issues with "Large icons" and "Medium icons" view layout modes in FileManager:
    - Item height was constant, now made height varying according to the contents as in older versions (similar to Windows Explorer). 
    - Adjusted item rendering so labels with tall letters (e.g letter "g") are not cropped at the bottom. 
    - Drag selecting was not working when pressing mouse button on empty spaces of label as in older versions (before 5.19).

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
  
    - **Improved:** Stability, accuracy for Presentation and Email formats.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer.

## Version 7.27.8 - February 11, 2019

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
  
    - When viewing CAD files, the default layout will be used not necessarily the model.

    - **Improved:** Stability, accuracy for Cad, Presentation, Email and ProjectManagement formats.

## Version 7.27.7 - January 29, 2019

  - **Improved:** Support for adding GleamTech assemblies to GAC (Global Assembly Cache), for example using with 
    SharePoint On Premise will be possible. In previous versions, the integrated AssemblyResolver failed 
    with "Could not load file or assembly 'GleamTech.AssemblyResolver, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, 
    PublicKeyToken=a05198837413a6d8'" error. This is because AppDomain.AssemblyResolve event is not fired by 
    .NET Framework (fusion) when the requesting assembly is installed to GAC. Now with a workaround, the integrated 
    AssemblyResolver will be successfully loaded and it will resolve other assemblies.

## Version 7.27.6 - January 22, 2019

  - **Improved:** Stability and performance for DocumentCache and ImageCache.

## Version 7.27.5 - January 11, 2019

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
  
    - **Improved:** DocumentViewer rendering accuracy and performance.

    - **Improved:** Stability, accuracy for Spreadsheet, Presentation and Email formats.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer.

## Version 7.27.0 - October 31, 2018

  - **Fixed:** Selection box borders in FileManager's right pane (for view layouts other than "Details") appeared dashed since 7.26.0

  - **Fixed:** Selection in FileManager's right pane was not retained visually when switching from "Details" to other view layouts.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
  
    - **Fixed:** Sent header for email formats (MSG, EML) in DocumentViewer were being 
      rendered corrupted (e.g. "<34pan cla34=headerLineTitle>DaPeTi6e:<34pan cla34=headerLineText>{0}")

    - **Fixed:** The change in v7.26.6 regarding opacity setting for text highlight annotations caused non-black highlights 
      to hide the text completely, now it's fixed to be effective only for black color for allowing blacked out text but for 
      other colors the opacity will be limited so the text is still visible.

    - **Improved:** Stability, accuracy for Spreadsheet and Email formats.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer.

  - **Improved:** Updated embedded database engine. 

## Version 7.26.6 - October 12, 2018

  - **Added:** Fixing orientation for read images automatically. The photos taken in a digital camera usually
    have an EXIF 'Orientation' tag that is set using a gravity sensor and these photos need to be adjusted 
    so that its orientation is suitable for viewing (i.e. top-left orientation).
    This feature will work for both image thumbnails in file manager and for images opened in Document Viewer

    Note that for seeing new orientation fixing in effect you will need to delete corresponding cache file for an image
    if it was already cached by previous versions.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Fixed:** The opacity setting for text highlight annotations was not being represented correctly in the 
      DocumentViewer. For example blacked out text using the Adobe text highlighting feature was no longer 
      blacked out in the viewer.

    - **Improved:** Stability, accuracy for Spreadsheet, Presentation, Email and ProjectManagement formats.

## Version 7.26.5 - October 4, 2018

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Improved:** DocumentViewer rendering accuracy and performance.

    - **Improved:** Beautified DocumentViewer user interface. Bookmarks tree has a new look which is faster and more elegant.
      Full text search panel is now more neat. Unified styles of UI elements like dialogs (notable in print dialog) 
      and context menus.
    
    - **Added:** New "Notes Panel" in DocumentViewer (right-side pane) for exploring and searching annotation comments in 
      the document.

    - **Added:** DocumentViewer print dialog now contains "Include Comments" option. This will add comment pages after each 
      document page that will include the comments (including replies) of annotations on that specific page.

    - **Fixed:** Signatures and other annotations in the documents were not being displayed in DocumentViewer.

    - **Fixed:** German language was not working due to a syntax error in the language file (it was translated by a customer).

## Version 7.26.0 - September 5, 2018

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer stability, accuracy for Spreadsheet, Presentation, ProjectManagement and Email 
    formats.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer.

## Version 7.25.5 - August 1, 2018

  - **Fixed:** Since v7.23.0, image thumbnails were not working on .NET versions before 4.6 due to MissingMethodException 
    (related to compiler emitting Array.Empty<T> method call which only exists in .NET 4.6).
    Now it works on .NET 4.0 and above as expected.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer.

## Version 7.25.0 - July 16, 2018

  - **Improved:** When creating public links for file files with unicode characters (e.g. german umlauts) in their 
    names, the "name in URL" will be transliterated better (all letters will be converted to closest corresponding 
    latin letters)

  - **Improved:** When downloading files with unicode characters (e.g. german umlauts) in their names, unencoded version
    of filename was provided in Content-Disposition header  for older browsers (utf-8 encoded version was already 
    provided for modern browsers). Now this alternative file name will be transliterated to ASCII for better old 
    browser support.
    
  - **Improved:** Document Viewer stability, accuracy for  Presentation, Spreadsheet, ProjectManagement and Email formats.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer.

## Version 7.24.0 - June 25, 2018

  - **Fixed:** Due to a bug in saving FileVista.config (not flushing file), after a successful update, update.aspx 
    was still shown and it was not redirected to FileVista login page.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved**: Document Viewer stability, accuracy for Spreadsheet formats.

## Version 7.23.5 - June 14, 2018

  - **Improved**: Document Viewer stability, accuracy for Portable, Presentation, Spreadsheet and ProjectManagement formats.

## Version 7.23.0 - May 22, 2018

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved**: Document Viewer stability, accuracy for Portable, Presentation and Spreadsheet formats.

## Version 7.22.0 - April 20, 2018

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Improved**: Improved stability, accuracy and restored conversion performance (was slower since v5.20.5) for 
      WordProcessing and Presentation formats.

    - **Improved**: Improved stability, accuracy for Spreadsheet and ProjectManagement formats.

## Version 7.21.6 - April 11, 2018

  - **Fixed:** The below error which occured after initial configuration on Windows 2008 Server:
    ArgumentNullException: Value cannot be null.
    This happened after completing configuration.aspx and going to login.aspx.
    It was related to config file not being updated with the last values due to a race condition (file change event)

  - **Fixed:** Handler routing was not working (HTTP 404) in ASP.NET Development Server included in Visual Studio 2010 
    due to how it handled Request.PathInfo differently from IIS/IIS Express.

  - **Fixed:** Building source code package in Visual Studio 2010 was broken due to higher <LangVersion> tag in csproj files.
    You needed to change C# version for each project to build sucessfully. Now reverted to "default" as in previous 
    releases so it builds out of the box.

## Version 7.21.5 - April 7, 2018

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer. Newer versions of Cad formats (AutoCad 2018) is now supported.

## Version 7.21.0 - March 30, 2018

  - **Fixed:** Document Viewer was broken ("engine not found" errors) in v7.20.5 due to obfuscation.

  - **Fixed:** IE 8 support was broken, FileManager failed to load with errors in browser console. Now it will render
    as expected.

  - **Fixed:** "Open" action (open in browser) in FileManager failed with HTTP 404 error for files in very deep folders.
    This happened because the generated URL for "Open" action was too long. IIS and ASP.NET usually have 255 character 
    limit by default in URL path part (due to legacy Windows limit).
    The reason we generated a long URL path was specially for being able to view HTML files which has references 
    to css and images (e.g. ../images/image1.jpg). This way relative paths inside the HTML work and images are not broken.
    However when you open a .txt file or .pdf file in browser this path in URL is pointless so from now on this
    feature will be limited to .html or .html files. So for file types other than HTML, the path is moved 
    to querystring (parts after ? by default allow long strings) to prevent HTTP 404 error in very deep folders.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer and image thumbnailer/viewer stability.

## Version 7.20.5 - March 24, 2018

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - Some DOCX files were causing infinite loop and failing to convert or display.

    - PPT/PPTX files with asian fonts were causing an error on some machines and failing to convert or display.

    - "Any word" search still did not find results when keywords had more than 1 hyphen in-between (e.g. "24-3-2018").

## Version 7.20.0 - March 16, 2018

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
    
    - "Any words" search did not find results when keywords had hyphens in-between.
    
    - "Any words" search would hang (infinite loop) when one of the words was a single hyphen.
    
    - A subsequent search in the viewer (without reloading the document) with new criteria where 
      no results are returned did not clear any of the highlights (yellow and orange both) from 
      the previous successful search.
    
    - Updated icons with better ones.

    - Improved stability.

## Version 7.19.5 - March 6, 2018

  - **Fixed:** When you clicked to preview a document inside a zip (or another archive file) Document Viewer would fail to
  load the file with "The stream is not reachable" error.

  - **Improved:** The upload window buttons were not visible on mobile, removed the window constrain so that upload 
    window can be moved on narrow screens. This is a quick fix until we redesign the upload window.

  - **Improved:** Updated image thumbnailer and viewer. New formats: SVG, JPEG 2000 (JP2), EMF, WMF, DIB, ICO

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer stability.

## Version 7.19.0 - February 17, 2018

  - **Added:** Clicking icon in the breadcrumb navigation bar (going to Home) will now list the root folders instead 
    of showing blank view which was confusing to some users. So now root folders will be visible in the right view 
    just like folders.

  - **Improved:** Rendering speed for "Large icons" and "Medium icons" view layout. 
    For cross-browser multi-line clamping, JS was used but now switched to pure CSS instead because 
    clamping already rendered text from JS could stall IE for a second or so, although it was not noticable in Chrome.
    So now, for overflowing item names, ellipsis will be shown in Chrome as it's the only browser that supports it 
    natively but for other browsers only consistent multi-line size will be maintained without ellipsis 
    (which is worth for better performance).
  
  - **Fixed:** Maximizing, resizing and then closing a child window (e.g. DocumentViewer window) left a mask on
    top of FileManager.

## Version 7.18.5 - February 12, 2018

  - **Fixed:** TIFF file support in DocumentViewer.
    - Since v7.14.0, the rendering speed of TIFF files was slower and the created .xpz and .pdf files were bigger.
      This was due to the fix "Viewing some TIFF files caused crashing of IIS worker process". Now the performance
      is restored, file sizes are optimized and crash is fixed at the same time.
    
    - TIFF files with an EXIF thumbnail (e.g. saved with Photoshop) caused "Image loading failed" error or 
      or before v7.14.0, the thumbnail stored in the EXIF was shown but not the high res TIFF file.
      Now the original TIFF image will be displayed as expected.
    
    - Some rare TIFF formats like WANG TIFF (Wang JPEG images encapsulated in TIFF files by Microsoft Office imaging Version)
      were not recognized.
    
    - If the file extension was .tiff/.tif but the actual format was another image format like PNG, the file was not loaded.
      Now even if the file is wrong image format, it will be loaded and displayed.

## Version 7.18.0 - February 7, 2018

  - **Fixed:** In "Details" layout mode (grid with columns) when switching folders, occasionally you would 
    see a half or full blank item listing especially when the folder had more than 1000 items. Scrolling a bit
    would fix the problem. This is now fixed completely.

  - **Improved:** Optimized file system providers.

## Version 7.17.0 - January 25, 2018

  - **Fixed:** "Format language" was broken in the previous version. When set, the culture 
    was not reflected in date column of FileManager.

  - **Improved:** Updated installer.

## Version 7.16.0 - December 18, 2017

  - **Improved:** DocumentViewer rendering accuracy and performance. New advanced search feature.

  - **Improved:** Video thumbnailer.

## Version 7.15.0 - November 21, 2017

  - **Fixed:** Empty folders were not showing up when browsing inside of 7zip archives.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer stability.

  - **Improved:** Updated libraries and installer.

## Version 7.14.0 - October 12, 2017

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Fixed:** The below error which happened in some environments:
    
      The type initializer for '_UXg' threw an exception. 
      ---> Could not load file or assembly 'PortableEngine, Version=2.7.3.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=a6f3cafa178e6038' or one of its dependencies. 
    
      The error happened either:
      
      - When ASP.NET impersonation was used via <identity impersonate="true" /> tag in web.config
      
      - When Glimpse library (diagnostics & insights library) was used in the project.
      
      In both cases, the error is now fixed.
        
    - **Fixed:** Viewing some TIFF files caused crashing of IIS worker process.

## Version 7.13.0 - August 28, 2017

  - **Improved:** DocumentViewer rendering accuracy and performance. Better text selection, cursor is changed
    to "text select" automatically when over selectable text. When pressed space bar "pan mode" is switched on.
	So behaves same as Adobe Acrobat.

  - **Fixed:** DocumentViewer and ImageViewer displayed black background behind pages/images in full-screen mode 
    on recent versions of Chrome.

## Version 7.12.0 - August 9, 2017

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Fixed:** Conversion of a large document could fail upon first view in DocumentViewer due to the default
      ASP.NET timeout (110 seconds). Increased timeout so that conversions that take long time are completed
	  successfully.

  - **Improved:** ControlBase.StateId will not be random and will change less often. It is now calculated according 
    to the url and control ID combination. This way more handler methods can make use of browser caching across
	different sessions.
	For example, image/video thumbnails will be more likely loaded from browser cache in consequent sessions for
	additional performance boost (no server hit even for HTTP 304 Not Modified).

## Version 7.11.2 - August 1, 2017

  - **Fixed:** When changing "Connect To" selection box in "Import Users" dialog, the description for below field
    was not changing as in previous verions due to a bug so it made the dialog confusing. For example, when
	"Machine (SAM Store of a computer)" is selected, the below field description will change to 
	"Machine name (required, eg. WIN-CONTOSO)" as expected, also container field will be disabled.

  - **Improved:** Added "Import Users" link button under number of users label in "Users" section of the 
    administration  panel for easy discovery of the feature. In previous versions, it was only accesible from 
	the context menu. Also made sure this feature is hidden in UI for Group Administrators.

## Version 7.11.1 - July 31, 2017

  - **Fixed:** DiskCache should not throw exception when the cache folder does not exist yet.
    For new installations, image/video thumbnail generation and DocumentViewer were broken due to this issue
	(user needed to manually create cache folders).

  - **Fixed:** In view layouts other than "Details", checkboxes were displayed over drag selection rectangle.

## Version 7.11.0 - July 13, 2017

  - **Added:** Azure Blob File System. You can now use an Azure Blob container like a regular folder on disk.
    "Choose Location" dialog now allows you to add a Azure Blob container (like Amazon S3 Bucket) when creating
	a RootFolder. Info on properties:

    - Path:
      Leave path empty to connect to the root of the container. For subfolders, path should be specified as 
	  a relative path without leading slash (eg. "some/folder")

	- Container, AccountName, AccountName:
	  Get these values from your Azure Portal (Storage Account -> Access Keys -> Connection String)
	
	- UseHttps, EndpointSuffix:
      These are optional, usually you don't need to change the default values (checked, "core.windows.net")

  - **Added:** Global "Item check boxes" option to "Application Settings" for forcing checkbox selection mode 
    regardless of being detected as a touch device.

  - **Improved:** Moved busy indicator from bottom status bar to breadcrumb navigation bar because 
    some browsers like Chrome show status tooltip on bottom left corner and hide the UI.

  - **Fixed:** When there were many video files in a folder, occasionally (on app start) the thumbnails would not 
    be loaded (infinite loading indicator). This happened due to a race condition in VideoThumbnailer.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

## Version 7.10.0 - June 20, 2017

  - **Added:** New "Item check boxes" mode for convenient multiple selection of files/folder especially on touch devices.
    The option can be toggled on "View" tab of ribbon. For tablet and phone devices this option will be turned on by
	default because drag-selecting is hard (long press and scroll) on these devices (unlike desktop where mouse is available). 
	So check-selecting is better for these devices. Check-selecting works with all (6) view layouts.

  - **Fixed:** Thumbnails were not loading on iOS (retina).

## Version 7.9.12 - June 15, 2017

  - **Fixed:** DocumentViewer failed to open DCM (dicom image) files.

## Version 7.9.11 - June 13, 2017

  - **Fixed:** When ASP.NET impersonation was used via <identity impersonate="true" ... /> tag
    in web.config, when accessing temporary folder impersonation was being reverted "just in case". 
    This will not be done anymore because it cause access errors in some cases.
    
	More info about ASP.NET impersonation:
    Actually the user in <identity> tag already has to have permissions on "Temporary ASP.NET Files" because
    ASP.NET runtime throws an error on startup so we can assume the user can already access
    if the application is running.

    <identity impersonate="true" /> (no user) impersonates IUSR when Anonymous Authentication is used
    and suprisingly IUSR is not member of IIS_IUSRS, only app pool identities are (via automatic injection).
    When Windows Authentication is used, this will be the logon user.
    So you are responsible for adding any impersonated user including IUSR
    to IIS_IUSRS group to grant "Temporary ASP.NET Files" access.

    After adding IUSR to IIS_IUSRS group, you need to run "iisreset" in Administrator Command Prompt.
    This is because changes to user's group membership are not effective until the next time the user
    logs on.

    If you are running the app pool as a domain user, the rules change on the automatic 
    injection of IIS_IUSRS token into the process at startup. 
    Solution: Create a new active directory user group named “IIS_IUSERS” in Users OU. 
    Then join your iis users to this group. After that, adding that user group to 
    local IIS_IUSRS group solves your problem.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

    - **Improved:** Got rid of HTTP headers used in DocumentViewer when downloading the XPZ. Parameters will
      instead passed via regular querystring. This will probably fix some random "Invalid XPZ file" errors.

## Version 7.9.9 - June 8, 2017

  - **Fixed:** When using a root folder with impersonation, Document Viewer and Video Player failed to open files.
    Image Viewer was opening the files.

## Version 7.9.8 - June 6, 2017

  - **Fixed:** Still happening issue, completely fixed now: When a license key was set and debugging in 
    Visual Studio on Windows 10 Creators Update, the opened browser hanged on forever. The issue only happened 
	on .NET 4.7 framework which came with Windows 10 Creators Update.

## Version 7.9.7 - June 3, 2017

  - **Improved:** ImageCache and DocumentCache locking, prevented double entries for same uniqueId with 
    different file name if requested at the same time.

## Version 7.9.6 - May 29, 2017

  - **Fixed:** When a license key was set and debugging in Visual Studio on Windows 10 Creators Update, 
    the opened browser hanged on forever. The issue only happened on .NET 4.7 framework which came with 
	Windows 10 Creators Update.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

	  - **Fixed:** Viewing TIFF files was broken with this error: 
	    Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
  
	  - **Fixed:** When viewing image formats, the generated PDF files in cache folder were kept open 
	    (could not be deleted).

## Version 7.9.5 - May 25, 2017

  - **Fixed:** Thumbnails sometimes appeared blank in FileManager especially in Chrome.
    Also improved lazy loading of thumbnails with better "in viewport" detection.
    Also fixed CTRL+F5 (or "disable cache" in developer tools) causing broken images issue.
 
  - **Fixed:** Search box label was not changing when changing folders and it was always displaying 
    the name of first root folder, although the search was done in the correct folder.

  - **Fixed:** Actions "Add to zip" and "Extract" could fail when dealing with zip files due to timeout.
    Also fixed zip generation for some files of certain size (exact divisible of 64k).

  - **Improved:** Date column will be empty for folders with default/min date (e.g. 01/01/0001), 
    this is especially useful for AmazonS3 and Archive folders which usually does not have a valid/useful date.

  - **Improved:**  Upload window: "Select files to be uploaded" label was truncated on high DPI.
    Added Remove and Clear buttons for better touch support (alternative to context menu), removed Close button.

  - **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

	- **Fixed:** Errors before "please wait a moment" dialog was not displayed. Also downloading indicator animation
	  (blue rectangle) was not displaying (the one after "please wait a moment" dialog).

    - **Improved:** Conversion accuracy for WordProcessing, Spreadsheet, Diagram formats. 

  - **Fixed:** License domain check for 3 letter domains failed as they were mistakenly treated as TLDs.
    Possible "Request is not available in this context" on probably earlier .net 4.0 versions when license key is set.

## Version 7.9.3 - May 4, 2017
  
  - **Fixed:** Login without user domain part feature introduced in 7.9.0 was not working properly. It worked  for 
    local machine users but not domain users as expected.

  - **Improved:** Document Viewer:
   
    - **Improved:** Conversion accuracy for Cad formats. 

    - **Added:** Grayscale printing. The print dialog in DocumentViewer now has a "Grayscale (Black and White)" option. 

## Version 7.9.2 - May 2, 2017

 - **Fixed:** Clicking on UI items was not working on Firefox 52+ when used on a touch-enabled device.
   Firefox changed a default browser behavior/setting in recent versions which broke clicking behavior 
   in some products: If you have a touch enabled laptop or PC monitor and when you use a mouse, 
   your clicks were not received by the controls displayed in Firefox. The problem did not happen if you 
   did not use a touch-enabled device.

 - **Improved:** Document Viewer:

   - **Fixed:** Sometimes DocumentViewer's vertical scrollbar's bottom button was not visible.
 
   - **Fixed:** Especially on IE, DocumentViewer's pan tool (hand cursor) was overlapping scrollbar so it made the user 
     think the hotspot was on the scrollbar but when the user moved the mouse the user was actually still panning the 
     document because the hotspot of the hand cursor was still on the document and not on the scrollbar. 
     This confused the user thinking into clicking on scrollbar caused "jumping back to the first page of the document".
     Now, when the user approaches a scrollbar, the hand cursor will be changed to default cursor and panning too near
     the scrollbar will be disabled. This way panning and scrolling actions will never be confused.

   - **Fixed:** When printing on IE, an extra blank page was being added at the end.

   - **Improved:** Viewer accuracy for Presentation and Imaging formats.

## Version 7.9.1 - April 28, 2017

- **Fixed:** "New User" dialog was broken after last update, i.e. password related fields were not visible thus
  a new user could not be created. Also "Edit User" dialog for imported users was not closing and changes were not saved.

- **Fixed:** "Choose Location" dialog was broken after last update, i.e. when creating a new root folder, clicking
  "Choose" button showed a page with server error.

- **Fixed:** Soft errors which may be logged in server logs:
  Resource 'GleamTech.FileVista.Resources.login-combined.js' not found in assembly 'GleamTech.FileVista ...'.  
  Resource 'GleamTech.FileVista.Resources.userdialog-combined.js' not found in assembly 'GleamTech.FileVista ...'.

- **Added:** A warning will be displayed next to Database Version field of About Dialog if there is a mismatch 
  between current and target database schema versions.

## Version 7.9.0 - April 24, 2017

- **Changed:** Licensing model. From now on, the license types are B10, B50, B250, B1000, Enterprise and Source.
  Your existing license type (Micro, Small, Medium, Large, X-Large, Enterprise, Enterprise + Source) will still be valid 
  but license keys are changed so please go to https://www.gleamtech.com/upgrade and acquire a new license key if you 
  want to use this version (or higher). If your one year maintenance has not ended, you will receive a new license key 
  without a charge. After your maintenance has ended, you will be able to upgrade to only new license types.

- **Fixed:** DocumentViewer was not displayed in IE11 with "Please use an HTML5 Compatible browser" error when 
  IE Enterprise Mode was active. This is because Enterprise Mode emulates IE8 and DocumentViewer supports IE9+.
  Now DocumentViewer will force latest IE mode and will display as expected even in Enterprise Mode.

- **Added:** About Dialog which shows useful information about the product such as exact version. About Dialog can be
  accessed with the new "About.." button on the toolbar of Administration page. The information is this dialog will be
  helpful when you want to update your version and when reporting a problem.

- **Added:** Imported users (Active Directory or any other external users that are imported) can now login without entering
  the domain part of the username. For example, if a user enters "John" in login dialog, first exact name will be searched 
  then "Contoso\John" (Down-Level Logon Name) and then "john@contoso" (User Principal Name) will be searched.

- **Fixed:** User Settings Dialog should not show "password change" option for imported users (Active Directory or any
  other external users that are imported) because passwords for these users are not stored in FileVista so changing password
  does not make sense and it's not even effective. Also "password change" dialog which is shown upon login if the password
  has expired will not be shown for these users.

## Version 7.8.2 - April 7, 2017

- **Improved:** High quality printing in DocumentViewer. The print dialog in DocumentViewer now has a "High Quality" option
  which is enabled by default. Printing in high quality will prevent pixelation of text.

## Version 7.8.1 - April 4, 2017

- **Improved:** Stability of DocumentViewer UI. Added back and forward navigation buttons to the toolbar.
  Error messages in the modal dialog can now be selected for copy/paste.

- **Fixed:** The soft error which may be logged in server logs:
  'GleamTech.DocumentUltimate.Resources.webviewer.Html5.external.images.ui-bg_glass_95_fef1ec_1x400.png' not found in assembly 'GleamTech.DocumentUltimate ...'

## Version 7.8.0 - March 25, 2017

- **Improved:** Document Viewer:
 
  - Re-enabled email formats (.msg).
  
  - Fixed pre-filled form fields of PDF files not displaying issue.

- **Fixed:** Drag & drop issue within FileManager. Thumbnail image was dragged when mouse moved (browser's internal d&d), 
  where the whole item should be dragged. Probably was broken since 7.7.0.

- **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

## Version 7.7.8 - February 16, 2017

- **Improved:** Stability of Document Viewer. 

## Version 7.7.7 - February 13, 2017

- **Fixed:** Bookmarks (Outlines) for PDFs were lost/missing in DocumentViewer.

- **Added:** New document formats for Document Viewer:
  - .ots - OpenDocument Spreadsheet Template
  - .otp - OpenDocument Presentation Template
  - .dcm - Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
  - .webp - WebP Image
  - .djvu - Deja Vu (DjVu) Image

- **Added:** File icons for extensions:
  - .ots
  - .otp
  - .jp2, .jpf, .jpx, .j2k, .j2c, .jpc (JPEG 2000)
  - .jxr, .wdp,. hdp (JPEG XR)
  - .dcm (DICOM Image)
  - .djvu	(DjVu Image)
  - .wmf, .emf, .dib

## Version 7.7.5 - January 22, 2017

- **Improved:** When closing "Create Public Link" window, the changes will be saved automatically, i.e. user will not have to 
  click "Update" button first. The "Update" button is moved next to "Test" button so that user can still apply the changes
  before testing the link if required. The "Close" button is also renamed to "OK" to imply the new auto-save behaviour.

- **Added:** Global policy options "Maximum public link age" and "Maximum public link hits" to the "Application Settings" window.
  Default value for this options is 0 which means they are not set. When this options are set, all public links will be
  first checked against this global policy even if they are not limited by the user in "Create Public Link" window.

- **Improved:** Public link urls will now include the hashed ID (letters and numbers e.g. .../y42/image.jpg) instead of 
  the plain number ID (e.g. .../175/image.jpg). In previous versions, it was still secure even when a plain number ID was 
  used because you would also need to know the exact file name in combination to guess the url. It was not possible to just 
  increment the number and access possible public links from the database. However the new mangled/unguessable IDs will
  ensure the user that public links are actually secure. The previously created public links will be still be accessible 
  via their same urls and they will keep working, the new type of urls will only be generated for newly created public links.

## Version 7.7.1 - January 16, 2017

- **Fixed:** Still in some cases, "Could not load file or assembly" errors (yellow screen of death) when the web app first starts

## Version 7.7.0 - January 11, 2017

- **Improved:** Document Viewer. Added JPEG XR (HD Photo) (.jxr, .wdp, .hdp) format support. Disabled browser's 
  right-click context menu for thumbnails in Document Viewer so that saving thumbnails is prevented.

- **Fixed:** When FIPS was enabled on the machine, you could see evaluation watermark in documents opened by 
  Document Viewer.

- **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

- **Improved:** Pinch and double-tap gestures (zoom in and out) on mobile devices.

## Version 7.6.4 - January 3, 2017

- **Fixed:** Still in some cases, "Could not load file or assembly" errors (yellow screen of death) when the web app first starts

## Version 7.6.3 - December 7, 2016

- **Fixed:** Possible "Could not load file or assembly ..." errors (yellow screen of death) when the web app 
  first starts

- **Fixed:** If the application pool of web app was running in 32-bit, you could still receive the error 
  "The evaluation version of the product has expired" when opening a document in DocumentViewer.
  This was fixed back in 2.0.1 but when in "Enable 32-bit applications" option was set to
  true in Advanced Settings of the application pool in IIS Manager, the error would resurface as the application
  pool uses 32-bit process in that case. Now this is also fixed for 32-bit (2.0.1 fixed only 64-bit) processes.

## Version 7.6.2 - December 5, 2016

- **Improved:** Stability of Document Viewer. 

## Version 7.6.1 - November 26, 2016

 - **Improved:** Merging of DLLs. We are now using an in-house built assembly merger and resolver. The new resolver
   is more performant (you should notice faster startup times), reduces the memory footprint, handles error better 
   and provides detailed logging in the temporary folder and also in VS Debug Program Output Window when attached. 
   Also the size of the product DLL files are slightly  reduced due to better compression. We will offer this new 
   assembly merger and resolver as a new product soon.

## Version 7.6.0.1 - November 4, 2016

 - **Fixed:** The installer was not listing remaining sites when there were web applications/virtual dirs in the first site.

## Version 7.6.0 - October 26, 2016

- **Improved:** Document Viewer. Full CAD support. DWG files (AutoCAD R13, R14, 2000, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016) and
  DXF files (AutoCAD R12, R13, R14, 2000, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016) can now be opened with DocumentViewer. 
  In previous versions, there was DWG and DXF support but it was pretty limited and it could only load very few AutoCAD 
  format versions. Now any AutoCAD file you throw at it will work.

## Version 7.5.6 - October 22, 2016

- **Fixed:** The installer was confused when a web site had SSL/HTTPS binding and it showed "???80?" in the list,
  so it was not possible to select this web site and install to it. The installer will also be able to create
  a new web site if there are not web sites in IIS.

- **Fixed:** Possible wrong "evaluation has expired" error in Document Viewer.

## Version 7.5.5 - October 17, 2016

- **Fixed:** Amazon S3 root folders can now list more than 1000 items. Also improved listing performance of folders so
  you should not have any problems with huge buckets.
  
- **Fixed:** When Amazon S3 bucket was empty, it caused an error.

- **Fixed:** IE11 on touch laptops were detected as a mobile device so Document Viewer was displayed in mobile mode. 
  Improved mobile device detection to prevent this kind of issues.

- **Improved:** Document Viewer. Some formats (e.g. common image formats and digital paper formats like XPS and EPUB) 
  will be opened faster for first-time view. More formats can be viewed with Document Viewer.

- **Improved:** Updated Media Player. Also updated the skin to youtube style.

- **Improved:** Image and document caches will now group cached files for the same inputs in subfolders. 
  Also the subfolder name will contain the original file name so it will be easier to locate the corresponding cached 
  files for an input. The old cached files will be arranged into the new structure automatically one by one when they 
  are accessed so no action is required.

## Version 7.5.0 - September 13, 2016

- **Added:** Thumbnails and Image Viewer will be available for the common raw file (camera format) extensions:

    - dng (Adobe)
    
    - arw, srf, sr2 (Sony)

    - cr2 (Canon)

    - nef, nrw (Nikon)

    - raf (Fuji)

    - orf (Olympus)

    - pef (Pentax)

    - kdc, dcr (Kodak)

    - mrw (Minolta)

    - erf (Epson)

    - rw2 (Panasonic)

    - dng (Leica)

    - srw (Samsung)

    - x3f (Sigma)
    
- **Added:** EPS format support (if TIFF preview image exists inside it) for thumbnails and Image Viewer.

- **Improved:** When a thumbnail generation fails for an image or a video file, an image of the file extension icon with a red
  error sign on the bottom right corner will be displayed. Thumbnail generation can fail when a file is corrupted or has
  some invalid format, for example some EPS files can not be opened if there is no TIFF preview image inside it. The
  special error image will be also cached so you will not see unnecessary errors related to thumbnail generation when you
  browse a folder with corrupted files every time. Also when clicked "Preview" on a corrupted image, Image Viewer will 
  show a 256x256 size of this special error image.

- **Improved:** Thumbnails will be generated vastly faster. EXIF thumbnails will be loaded and resized if possible. Also usual 
  resize (Thumbnails or Image Viewer) will be faster for Jpeg files as downscaling will be used while reading them when 
  possible.

- **Improved:** Document Viewer. Updated document conversion engine, conversions will be faster and support for some file types 
  like Microsoft Project (.mpp) are improved (chance of failing to load some files is reduced).
  Cache will not keep the file if conversion is failed before viewing the document. This will prevent possible 
  ghost zero-size files. This way only successful results will be cached. This should prevent possible "Invalid XPZ file"
  errors.

- **Improved:** Updated Media Player.

## Version 7.4.0 - August 9, 2016
- **Fixed**: Dynamic feature detection was broken. When GleamTech.DocumentUltimate.dll, GleamTech.ImageUltimate.dll 
  or GleamTech.VideoUltimate.dll was not included in bin folder, this caused a runtime error. Now these files can
  be excluded safely again to opt-out from the corresponding features as expected.
- **Added**: PSB (Photoshop Large Document Format) format support for thumbnails and image viewer.
- **Added**: File icon for PSB extension.
- **Improved**: Document Viewer.

## Version 7.3.7 - May 22, 2016
- **Improved**: When access is denied to the cache path, a more user-friendly error message with instructions will be displayed.
  Also the physical path will not be included in the message for security purpose.
- **Fixed**: When in details view, clicking on "Type" column did not sort the files.
- **Fixed**: Unnecessary "Path cannot be discovered" error when a root folder had no permissions.

## Version 7.3.6 - May 16, 2016
- **Fixed**: Moving a folder which had files at second and higher level depth failed.
- **Added**: Additional information like TotalSize, ElapsedTime and TransferRate will be logged for Download event.
- **Improved**: Updated media player, document conversion, graphics and video engines.

## Version 7.3.5.1 - May 12, 2016
- **Fixed**: Public links were broken, i.e. not accessible due to error. Also editing root folder with no acess control
  was broken due to same underlying problem.

## Version 7.3.5 - May 11, 2016
- **Fixed**: Some problems continued on Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge browsers after the new drag and drop feature.
  For example, columns on the file list were not clickable anymore. With this version all problems related to clicking
  should be fixed and clicking should feel more responsive again.
- **Fixed**: Some UI quirks. For example error window was still displaying behind the background mask on some cases and  
  minimize/restore state of a window was not stable (scrolling the main view behind the window caused it the window
  to minimize).
- **Improved**: Made the default action of dragged items "Move to" even if the drag is made across view (eg. dragging from 
  main view to folder tree). So "Copy to" action will be switched on only if CTRL key is pressed. This exactly mimics 
  "Windows Explorer" behaviour.
- **Fixed**: After you drag and drop in the folder tree, you could get an error message when you clicked the parent folder.
  When dragging, the tree was confused and changed the current selection to the dragged one (focused) although this was 
  not visually reflected so we had a ghost selection.  
- **Fixed**: Prevented horizontal scroll of folder tree when dragging on the right edge and waiting for 500ms. The scroll helper
  should only work vertically for the folder tree.
- **Fixed**: While dragging on the bottom of the main view or folder tree, the page would flicker.
- **Improved**: Updated PDF icon with the most recent one. Also fixed large icons for ascx, ashx, asmx, aspx, config, css, htm, 
  js, resx, xsd, xsl, xml, h extensions so they will not be pixelated (not upsized from small icon).
- **Fixed**: Icons for 1 letter extensions were not shown (eg. .c and .h), also "Type" column showed "File" instead of e.g.
  "C File".

## Version 7.3.1 - May 9, 2016
- **Fixed**: Clicking and selecting folders was broken due to new drag and drop feature on Internet Explorer and 
  Microsoft Edge browsers. Other browsers like Chrome and Firefox did not have this problem.
- **Fixed**: Thumbnail images were being dragged instead of the item on Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge browsers.

## Version 7.3.0 - May 9, 2016
- **Added**: Drag and drop feature with "Copy to" and "Move to" actions. Drag and drop works just like "Windows Explorer" 
  both visually and functionality-wise including the modifier keys, i.e. during dragging pressing CTRL key will force 
  "Copy to", pressing SHIFT key will force "Move to" and pressing ESC key will cancel the drag.
- **Fixed**: "Paste" action was not displayed when right clicked on a folder on the right side (main view not the folder tree 
  on the left)
- **Fixed**: Close icon of a child window required multiple clicks on some occasions to close the window.
- **Fixed**: In the folder tree, when pasted into a collapsed folder, it was not expanded although it's icon showed as 
  expanded state (down arrow)
- **Fixed**: When an error window was displayed, occasionally it was displayed behind the background mask, so it was not
  possible to close the window unless you pressed ESC key.
- **Fixed**: Update from older version like 4.x was failing due to old config file parsing errors.

## Version 7.2.0 - April 24, 2016
- **Added**: New more advanced installer which automatically enables minimum required Windows features/roles so you can
  install FileVista directly to a clean/initial Windows instance without needing to manually configure it beforehand.
  This installer will also apply .Net Framework 4.0.3 update which is the last update for .Net Framework 4 on Windows 2008
  and before (also on Windows 7 and before)
- **Improved**: Installer should now be able to update an existing installation. Also in Windows Control Panel the program 
  will be listed with version in name like "FileVista 7.2.0".
- **Changed**: Installer will now create an Application Pool named "FileVista" instead of "FileVista (XXXXX)". You can also
  delete old profile folders named like "FileVista (XXXXX)" under C:\Users as XXXXX was a random value there may be more
  than one profile folder that was left over from older installations.
- **Improved**: The update process, the update wizard will automatically backup important files like FileVista.config and 
  FileVista.vdb5 before starting an update. The backed up files will be zipped as "backup-X.X.X.zip" in "App_Data\Backup""
  folder. This will make it easier to roll back your original configuration if something goes wrong while updating the 
  database. In the past, you needed to backup these files manually before starting the update just in case.
- **Changed**: Location of FileVista.vdb5 database file from "App_Data\Database" to "App_Data" for easier updates and migrations. 
  This way, it will sit next to FileVista.config and you can copy only these 2 files to move your configuration to another 
  instance easily. "App_Data\Database" folder will be deleted and not used anymore, note that this folder will be backed up
  with the new "automatic backup before update" feature as described above. If you are using SQL Server as a database 
  then nevermind this change because in that case you will only have FileVista.config and not FileVista.vdb5.
- **Improved**: Updated german language file.
- **Improved**: Document Viewer.

## Version 7.1.6 - April 11, 2016
- **Added**: TGA (TARGA) format support for thumbnails and Image Viewer.
- **Improved**: In Document Viewer, when session expires, a "Refresh page" dialog will be shown with a countdown of 10 seconds.
  Also server side errors while loading the document will be handled better and more detailed error messages will be
  displayed instead of a generic message.

## Version 7.1.5 - April 4, 2016
- **Added**: "Print" permission for controlling print, download as pdf and text selection actions in the document viewer.
- **Changed**: Removed "Disable previewer printing" and "Disable previewer text selection" options from "Application Settings"
  window as these will now be controlled by the new Print permission per folder-basis.
- **Improved**: The Document Viewer;
	- **Added**: "Download" and "Download as PDF" buttons to the toolbar.
	  "Download" button will be disabled when there is no Download permission and "Download as PDF" button 
	  will be disabled when there is no Print permission. This is because, downloading a DOCX file as a PDF file is 
	  considered same as printing that document.
	- **Improved**: The toolbar is now reponsive, buttons will not be hidden and they will flow naturally to next row below.
	  So all the available buttons will be visible regardless of the viewer size. Also the buttons are spaced better.
	- **Fixed**: Some scanned documents were displayed as blurred, i.e. the text was unreadable.
	- **Fixed**: Some XPS files were not being displayed at all.
	- **Fixed**: Even when the printing was disabled, the user could still open "Print Dialog" by pressing CTRL + P.
- **Changed**: CreatePublicLink permission value is changed from 16384 to 1073741824 (1 << 30). If you were serializing this
  value to somewhere, you should update the stored value.

## Version 7.1.0 - March 24, 2016
- **Added**: New redesigned Document Viewer with same features.

## Version 7.0.9 - March 13, 2016
- **Fixed**: Updated GleamTech.Core for fixing license domain issue, i.e.  www prefix should be considered same as 
  the parent (e.g. contoso.com and www.contoso.com should be treated the same).
- **Fixed**: Unable to upload or download a file with name containing &# character sequence.

## Version 7.0.8 - February 7, 2016
- **Fixed**: In "Edit Root Folder" dialog, ImpersonationInfo property was unnessarily added to location string when
  "Specific user" or "Authenticated user" was selected.
- **Improved**: Updated media player, document conversion, graphics and video engines.
- **Improved**: Increased size of database fields AllowedFileTypes and DeniedFileTypes from 255 to 500 so that upto 
  100 extensions could be added.

## Version 7.0.7 - January 27, 2016
- **Fixed**: A security vulnerability with resource.ashx when application pool account was misconfigured.
- **Fixed**: When the admin account logged in, he could see a blank page due to a JS error. This happened when admin account 
  did not have any root folders to access. Also from now on, regular users will not be warned on the login page if they 
  do not have any root folders, instead they will be allowed to login and they will see the file manager (empty) but with 
  "No root folders defined" warning in the navigation pane.

## Version 7.0.6 - January 24, 2016
- **Fixed**: HTTP 404 error when trying to delete a public link in "Manage public links" window.
- **Improved**: Updated media player for better Firefox compatibility.

## Version 7.0.5 - January 17, 2016
- **Fixed**: Image Viewer file types were not being considered as preview types so "Preview" command was not being
  shown/enabled in context menu and toolbar. However double-clicking on the file was still opening the Image Viewer.
- **Fixed**: .mhtml file extension icon was not shown like .mht.
- **Fixed**: Error on some pages like "Edit User" window when .Net 4.5.2 was installed on the server:
	  WebForms UnobtrusiveValidationMode requires a ScriptResourceMapping for 'jquery'.
	  Please add a ScriptResourceMapping named jquery(case-sensitive)
- **Fixed**: Unnecessary errors like "...promise.edbeae12ab383add4357.map not found" were being logged in Event Viewer.

## Version 7.0.4 - January 11, 2016
- **Fixed**: Intermittent "Could not load document" error in Document Viewer although the document was loaded and displayed.
- **Fixed**: Media Player was not starting to play a video if it was in an archive (eg. zip file)
- **Fixed**: For video thumbnails, the duration overlay text was not aligned exactly at center of the rectangle.

## Version 7.0.1 - January 10, 2016
- **Fixed**: "Unexpected character encountered" error while creating a new root folder or saving an existing root folder 
  on "Edit Root Folder" dialog.
- **Fixed**: Image Viewer did not refresh an image if it was edited externally, last modified time was not
  taken into account so the old version from the browser cache was displayed.
- **Improved**: Made purchase date display as long date (January 8, 2016) in "License Information" dialog.

## Version 7.0 - January 6, 2016
- **Added**: New Windows 10 UI theme.
- **Added**: New flat/modern file type icons.
- **Added**: New advanced Document Viewer with High Resolution. Text, fonts and vector elements are preserved and 
  rendered in high-res with no rasterization. Zoom in as much as you want, your document will look great.
  Also performance in regards to the old viewer will be much better.
- **Added**: Advanced Image Viewer with zooming and panning feature. The viewer can display several image formats including 
  Photoshop files.
- **Improved**: New faster image thumbnail generation with caching support.
- **Improved**: Many minor fixes and performance improvements.

## Version 6.8 - October 13, 2015
- **Added**: New advanced video thumbnail generation which is vastly faster and more stable than the previous feature.
  No more unexpected crashes due to bxsdk32.dll or ffmpeg.exe on some machines. We developed a library to directly 
  access video files so there will be no more side effects of launching an external command line exe from IIS. The 
  setting "FileUltimate:DisableVideoThumbnails" in web.config still works but as we solved the stability problems, 
  you should not need to disable thumbnails for video files anymore. We may offer this high-performance and stable 
  video frame reading library as a separate product soon.
- **Improved**: The picture quality of the generated video thumbnails, you will notice that the duration text on the bottom
  right is now more crisp and readable.

## Version 6.7.8 - October 5, 2015
- **Fixed**: Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure.dll was not being copied to GleamTech.FileVista\bin folder when building the
  source code package as Visual Studio strangely does not copy indirect "Copy Local" references if they are already 
  in GAC on the development machine. This of course caused an error when published if the target server did not have 
  this dll in GAC.
- **Improved**: Some minor issues are fixed and improvements are made.

## Version 6.7.7 - September 24, 2015
- **Fixed**: Variables {User} and {Domain} in root folder's name or path were not being resolved correctly when the user 
  was in UPN format (user@domain).
- **Improved**: The way some native DLLs are loaded so the below problem which still happens on some rare machines may be 
  fixed:
	
	Intermittent w3wp.exe crashes related to bxsdk32.dll or bxsdk64.dll, in Windows Event Viewer an error similar to 
	below was being	logged:

	Faulting application name: w3wp.exe, version: 8.0.9200.16384, time stamp: 0x5010885f
	Faulting module name: bxsdk32.dll, version: 3.3.5.24, time stamp: 0x55803b90
	Exception code: 0xc0000005
  
  Note that if you still get this error after this version, you can use this undocumented setting in your web.config:

	  <configuration>
		<appSettings>
		  <add key="FileUltimate:DisableVideoThumbnails" value="1" />
		</appSettings>
	  </configuration>

  This setting will disable generating thumbnails for video files only (image files are not effected) so that you can 
  avoid this error altogether by sacrificing only the related feature.

## Version 6.7.5 - July 19, 2015
- **Improved**: Embedded database (VistaDB) performance. For example, login time for users with lots of access controls, 
  should be vastly reduced.
- **Fixed**: FIPS compliance was broken when installing (not update) for the first time. New installations failed at the 
  last step of Configuration Wizard.
- **Fixed**: For new installations, browser language was not loaded correctly when you visited login page for the first time.
  As a result, if you entered wrong credentials, login button stayed grayed out without showing any error messages.
- **Fixed**: Length of Location field of RootFolder was increased to 500 characters in v6.7, however for new installations
  (not updates), it was still being limited to 255 characters.
- **Fixed**: Changes in a custom language file were not being reflected when you refreshed the browser.
- **Added**: "Create public link" and "Manage public links" buttons to the ribbon (top) bar so that they are not only 
  accessible from the file context menu. This is especially useful for iOS devices where there is no "right-click"
  concept. So public link related actions will be always accessible.
- **Improved**: Ribbon (top) bar will now show left and right scrollers when there is not enough space (overflow) so that all
  buttons are accessible regardless of the window size.

## Version 6.7 - July 6, 2015
- **Added**: Amazon S3 file system. You can now use an Amazon S3 bucket like a regular folder on disk.
- **Improved**: "Edit Root Folder" window to support multiple location types like Physical and AmazonS3. The new "Choose"
  button will open a new window where you can set properties specific to a location type. This means you don't need 
  to bother with formatting location strings correctly (eg. guessing property names)

## Version 6.6.6 - June 26, 2015
- **Fixed**: Open/Download actions failed with file names containing % and & characters. This is because since v4.6.1,
  paths/file names were being included directly in URL and IIS and ASP.NET by default disallows certain characters in 
  a URL, so made sure all of these characters are handled specially.
- **Fixed**: FIPS compliance (error about MD5 algorithm) was broken due to how DLL was being built since 4.5.2.
- **Improved**: When opening a file (not previewing), if the browser did not recognize this file type (ie. it has no default
  viewer for it), it would show open/save file dialog as expected. However as a side-effect, a blank window was being
  left open. This window is normally used by browser to display supported file types inline/embedded. However there was
  no reliable way to detect if the browser actually displayed the file via its plugins or showed open/save dialog, thus
  we were leaving the window open. Finally we developed a workaround to detect this in a cross-browser way. From now on,
  if the window is blank, it will be closed automatically.
- **Improved**: Document Viewer will now be localized (tooltips for top toolbar buttons etc.) according to the current 
  display language.

## Version 6.6.5 - June 19, 2015
- **Improved**: From now on slash (/), backslash (\) and colon (:) characters can be used in root folder name. 
  Paths will now be represented with square brackets around root folder name eg. [RootFolderName]:\Some\Folder 
  (in previous versions it was like RootFolderName:\Some\Folder). This way previously illegal characters will be 
  escaped safely. Now only limitation is that the name can not contain the character sequence "]:" (right square 
  bracket preceding colon) which is very unlikely.
- **Changed**: Excluded html, xml and txt file extensions for preview as it makes more sense to open them directly with
  browser (document viewer is not very useful for these file types). Considering referenced resources (eg. images) 
  for html pages can be loaded since v6.6.1, it's better to make "Open" action default for best display of these files.

## Version 6.6.4 - June 16, 2015
- **Improved**: More accurate impersonation according to the folder being local or network. By detecting if the folder 
  is local or network, best logon type will be selected to make sure impersonation succeeds. This will especially
  fix problems when connecting to permission-protected local folders via non-local/domain users.
- **Fixed**: "Authenticated User=true" setting for location was not working as expected. This setting allows to impersonate 
  the user already authenticated via IIS Windows Authentication mode.
- **Fixed**: When impersonating a user while accessing a local folder, if this user did not have NTFS Modify permission on 
  App_Data folder, "access denied" error occured. The error occured either if logging events to database failed or 
  caching by document viewer (preview) failed due to not being able to write in App_Data folder. From now on, 
  impersonation will be reverted (back to AppPool identity) at the correct time so you won't need to give Modify 
  permission for your users on App_Data folder.
- **Improved**: For "Open" and "Preview" actions, if the file is already open in a window, then that existing window will
  be brought to the front instead of creating a new window every time for the same file.
- **Added**: "Excluded extensions for preview" setting to "Folder Browsing" tab of "Application Settings" window. 
  This can be set to comma-separated file extensions. "Preview" action for these file extensions will be disabled.

## Version 6.6.2.2 - June 10, 2015
- **Fixed**: CreatePublicLink permission was represented with wrong value in UI. It was bound to Paste permission.
- **Fixed**: Expanding the collapsed NavigationPane caused a JS error. On IE11, the pane was not even expanding due to error.
- **Fixed**: When text selection was disabled, "File not found" error occured for DXF files on Document Viewer. 

## Version 6.6.2 - June 9, 2015
- **Added**: "Disable previewer printing" and "Disable previewer text selection" settings to "Folder Browsing" tab of 
  "Application Settings" window. You can now disable printing of files displayed in Document Viewer and disable 
  text selection (ie. copying via CTRL + C) on the Document Viewer for further protection of your files.

## Version 6.6.1 - June 5, 2015
- **Added**: "Open" action now can display HTML pages correctly which has relative resource links (images, CSS, JS).
  All linked resources (eg. <img src="../images/some.jpg">) will be resolved so HTML page will be rendered perfectly 
  (no broken images or styles). This mimics the behaviour when you open a local HTML file in Windows Explorer.
- **Fixed**: When using Microsoft Forefront UAG (reverse proxy), the built-in Document Viewer was not displaying document 
  pages (blank pages). It was working when accessed via localhost but not when accessed via external URL.
- **Fixed**: When logged in with an imported AD user and accessed a local folder (not network folder/UNC path), 
  impersonation was not working so "Access denied" error occured even the AD user had permissions on the local folder.

## Version 6.6 - June 1, 2015
- **Added**: Advanced Document Viewer which can open and display (read-only) wide range of document and image file formats:
	- Portable Document Format: pdf
	- Microsoft Word: doc, docx, docm, dot, dotx, dotm
	- Microsoft Excel: xls, xlsx, xlsm, xlsb
	- Microsoft PowerPoint: ppt, pptx, pps, ppsx
	- Microsoft Visio: vsd, vdx, vss, vsx, vst, vtx, vsdx, vdw
	- Microsoft Project: mpp, mpt
	- Microsoft Outlook: msg, eml, emlx
	- OpenDocument Formats: odt, ott, ods, odp
	- Rich Text Format: rtf
	- Plain Text File: txt
	- Comma-Separated Values: csv
	- HyperText Markup Language: html, mht, mhtml
	- Extensible Markup Language: xml
	- XML Paper Specification: xps
	- AutoCAD Drawing File Format: dxf, dwg (2004)
	- Image files: bmp, gif, jpg, png, tiff, multi-page tiff
	- Electronic publication: epub
	- Windows Icon: ico
  From now on, your users don't need to have an application (eg. Microsoft Office) on their computer to be able to view
  these documents.
- **Added**: "Preview" permission to differentiate "opening files with built-in viewers (Document Viewer and Media Player)"
  from "downloading and opening files locally (or opening inline in browser)". Now you can allow your users 
  to only preview files but not download them when required. This can be useful for copyrighted/protected documents,
  images, videos and audios.
- **Added**: "Preview" action (next to "Open" action) to the ribbon and file context menu.
- **Added**: "Preview" event and "On preview" notification permissions.
- **Added**: "Download on double-click" setting to "Folder Browsing" tab of "Application Settings" window. From now on, 
  when you double-click on a file, "Preview" action will be triggered. If "Preview" permission is not allowed or the 
  file type is not previewable by any of the built-in viewers, then "Open" (open inline in browser or open locally) 
  action will be triggered. If you wish to use the same behaviour as in previous versions, ie. trigger "Download" 
  action on double click then you can check "Download on double-click" checkbox.

## Version 6.5.7.2 - May 27, 2015:
- **Fixed**: "Not a valid Win32 FileTime" error when extracting some zip files on some machines.

## Version 6.5.7 - May 20, 2015
- **Changed**: Dropped Medium Trust (Partial Trust) support so Full Trust is required from now on. Few years ago, Microsoft
  officially stated that they have provided guidance to hosters that they should migrate away from Medium Trust and use 
  proper OS-level isolation instead (KB2698981) and most of the shared hosters are already using Full Trust. We needed 
  to do this change to be able add advanced features in future versions as Medium Trust has some severe limitations. 
  Note that before this version some features like generating thumbnails for video files already required Full Trust 
  and they were disabled silently when running under Medium Trust. From now on, the DLL will fail to load with an error
  when Full Trust is not available (the DLL is built differently and it requires Full Trust to even load). Note that 
  this change does not matter if you are using a dedicated hosting or if you have your own servers because by default 
  ASP.NET is already installed with Full Trust on Windows Servers.

## Version 6.5.6 - May 13, 2015
- **Added**: 2 new connection options on "Import Users" window: "Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)" and 
  "Machine (SAM store of a computer)" in addition to AD DS (Full AD). Now you can import users from 3 kind of stores.

## Version 6.5.5 - May 6, 2015
- **Added**: Ability to bulk import users from Active Directory. The new "Import Users" window will allow you to search AD
  for users and import selected users into FileVista. User names can be imported either as sam account name 
  (eg. Contoso\User) or as user principal name (eg. user@contoso.com). Other AD attributes such as Display Name, Email 
  and Description will be also imported if they are available.
- **Added**: Imported AD users can login directly from FileVista's login page. You don't need turn on IIS Windows 
  Authentication mode (which shows browser's own login window) anymore. Note that if you were already using IIS Windows 
  Authentication mode, then the users you manually created will not be able to login from FileVista's login page as they
  are not marked as imported. These users can be marked as imported by setting the new "Type" field to 1 in the database
  though or you can continue to use IIS Windows Authentication mode as it's still supported.
- **Improved**: You can now delete multiple users at once on the administration page. This will be especially useful because
  of new "Import Users" feature, considering you may import many users at once and realize you made a mistake 
  (eg. selected wrong user name format).
  
## Version 6.5 - April 29, 2015
- **Added**: Media Player which can open and play video files (mp4, m4v, f4v, mov, flv, webm, ogv and on some browsers mp4v,
  3g2, 3gp, mkv) and audio files (mp3, aac, m4a, f4a, ogg, oga, vorbis). Media Player will first try Html5 video feature 
  of the browser and if not supported it will try Flash mode. If a media format is not playable on the browser, 
  media player will prompt the user to try opening the file directly.
- **Fixed**: When opening a video file of format like avi or wmv on IE, Windows Media Player was not able to play the file.
  From now on, Windows Media Player (or other players) will be able to stream the opened file without any problems.
- **Added**: Assigned file icons and thumbnail generation to some additional media formats which the new Media Player supports.
- **Improved**: When downloading a single file, resuming in the browser will be possible. Note that this feature was already 
  supported when downloading via Public Links. It was also supported when downloading from the file manager in older 
  versions (v5.x) but we had disabled it for preventing some confusions about security.

## Version 6.4 - April 1, 2015
- **Added**: ArchiveFileSystem which supports these archive formats: zip, 7z, rar, tar, gz, tar.gz (tgz), tar.bz2 (tbz, tbz2). 
From now on, the contents of these archive formats can be browsed just like regular folders. This is similar to 
"Compressed Folders" in Windows Explorer but for all archive formats not just for zip format. In addition, it supports 
displaying thumbnails while in archive and browsing nested archive files so it's more advanced than Windows Explorer's
feature. The zip files can be modified but other formats are read-only as of current version. For example, you can 
directly upload into zip files or download files directly from all archive files. You can now use "Extract all to" 
or "Extract all here" actions for all archive types and not just for zip files. As archives are treated like regular 
folders, you can also use Copy/Cut/Paste actions to extract specific files and folders. When you browse a folder which 
contains archive files, these will be displayed like a folder (but with their specific archive icon) in the folder tree
(navigation pane). Added better icons for all supported archive formats to be consistent with the original zip file icon.
- **Fixed**: The browser was freezing when opening large folders (> 10,000 items) even in "Details" view layout.
- **Improved**: When opening a folder with more than 1,000 items, the view layout will be automatically changed to "Details"
as it's the fastest view layout (it renders only visible rows). Other view layouts will be also disabled as they will
slow down the browser after 1,000 items and they will be actually useless for browsing that many items.
- **Improved**: The preselected language in the login page drop down will match the browser setting, so that a user mostly 
does not need to change the language. Note that still like in previous versions, after the first time user selects the 
language and logins, language selection will be saved to a cookie and next time user comes back to the login page the 
saved language will be selected automatically. The browser setting will be only taken into consideration when it's the 
first visit or when the saved cookie is deleted. Also if there are multiple languages set in the browser, they will be 
tried in order and the closest available one will be chosen.
- **Improved**: Some minor issues are fixed and improvements are made.

## Version 6.3 - March 2, 2015
- **Added**: Long path (upto 32,000 characters) support. Normally paths upto 260 characters were supported 
  due to limitations of the .NET framework. From now on, it's possible to browse very long paths (very deep folders) 
  and do any action in them without any error.
- **Added**: Abstracted file system so adding new types of file systems will be easier. So managing files in a database
  or in a zip file will be possible. In next versions, we plan to first add support for zip files and other popular 
  archive formats like rar, 7z, tar etc.
- **Improved**: Path security. In previous versions, leaking underlying physical paths in error messages to the user 
  was prevented for most cases. With this version, all cases are handled as file system is abstracted and isolated.
- **Improved**: Quota handling. From now on, you can not break the limit in subfolders of a root folder with quota.
- **Improved**: Finding copy name for existing files. For example, if "Image (2).jpg" exists "Image (3).jpg"
  will be created and not "Image (2) (2).jpg".
- **Improved**: Upload speed for Html4 method vastly (12x-14x faster). Although Html4 method is not used too frequently
  as it is the last fallback method (Html5 -> Silverlight -> Flash -> Html4), this improvement will be useful for
  old browsers.
- **Added**: Display and format language support. In previous versions, only one kind of language could be selected.
  With this version, language setting is separated into two. Display language controls the user interface language 
  and format language controls the number and date/time formats. Both language settings will be available on
  "User Settings" and "Application Settings" windows.
- **Improved**: Many minor issues are fixed and improvements are made.

## Version 6.2.2 - January 23, 2015
- **Improved**: From now on App_Data\Tools folder and contents (DLLs etc.) will not be created. 
  This version will automatically delete this folder when first loaded. If it fails and you still see this folder, 
  you can delete this folder completely. The DLLs will be generated in "Temporary ASP.NET Files" folder 
  for the application instead so you will be able to publish your site without hitting any locked files.
- **Fixed**: Intermittent crashes related to bxsdk32.dll or bxsdk64.dll "0xc0000005 - Access Violation" error 
  were being logged in Windows Event Viewer when running on IIS.

## Version 6.2.1.4 - January 14, 2015
- **Fixed**: Intermittent crashes related to bxsdk32.dll "0xc0000005 - Access Violation" error 
  when running on Visual Studio (especially 2010) or when running "ASP.NET Web Site Administration Tool".

## Version 6.2.1 - December 27, 2014
- Fixed some UI issues:
  - On iOS, "Extract All" button on the ribbon was not showing its menu when clicked.
  - Replaced the ribbon pin icon with a better one.
  - On IE 8, disabled buttons and menu items had ugly text rendering (artifacts) and their icons were not semi-transparent as they were supposed to be.
  - Made hover color gray for disabled menu items.
  - On IE 8 and 9, context menus were not hidden when clicked on an empty area in the main view.
  - In details layout for main view, the "Name" column was not smoothly resizing when dragged.

## Version 6.2 - December 20, 2014
- **Added**: Up button for navigating to parent folder easily.
- **Added**: Breadcrumb navigation which allows users to keep track of their location and to drill down folders easily. 
- **Added**: Refresh button for refreshing the current folder as an alternative to the context menu action.
- **Added**: Search box for doing basic search in the current folder. 
This is the initial iteration for future support of more advanced recursive search.
- **Improved**: Changed drag selection behavior to prepare for future drag & drop support. 
Selection rectangle will appear only when clicked on an empty area (not on icon, thumbnail or text). 
This mimics Windows Explorer behavior.
- **Improved**: Prevented displaying "permission denied" message box when double-clicked on a file in a folder with no Download permission. 
Instead, double-click will be silently ignored.
- **Improved**: Refresh behavior in navigation pane for cut and paste operation.
- **Fixed**: Some minor UI glitches.

## Version 6.1.5 - November 11, 2014
- **Fixed**: When using "Authenticated User=true" for root folder location, video thumbnails could not be generated (image thumbnails were fine) due to an impersonation issue.
- **Fixed**: Prevented timeout errors for video thumbnail generation which was occuring when there were a lot of video files in the folder. This caused some files to not have a thumbnail (icon only).
- **Fixed**: When an action was done (eg. renaming a folder) that caused the folder node in the navigation pane to refresh, the current folder selection was lost and the parent folder 2 levels up was being selected.
- **Added**: In v6.1, "creating path if it did not exist automatically" feature on root folder dialog was disabled to prevent confusion regarding access denied messages.
  From now on, if the path does not exist but it's accessible, user will be asked if path should be created with a confirmation message so that user does not have to create the folder manually on the server.
- **Improved**: Reduced deployment size by 40% relative to previous v6.x versions.

## Version 6.1 - October 29, 2014
- **Added**: Built-in impersonation support. RootFolder locations can be specified with user credentials.
 No more web.config settings are required to connect as a specific user or as the IIS authenticated user to a path.
	- For connecting as a specific user to a path (usually network paths), location should be specified with credentials in this format:
	Path=\\server\share; User Name=USERNAME; Password=PASSWORD
	Path can be any of the allowed types.
	User Name can be speficied as Domain\User, User@Domain (UPN format), MachineName\User or User (local user).
	If a value contains semi-colon character, that value should be enclosed in single quotes (eg. Password='PASSWORD') or double quotes (eg. Password="PASSWORD").
    - If IIS authentication is used for this site, location can be specified like this to connect as the already authenticated user:
    Path=\\server\share; Authenticated User=true
- **Improved**: RootFolder dialog. Location textbox will be editable after creation from now on. This will make migrating to
different servers easier (eg. changing drive letters). Added tooltip help on how to enter location in several different formats.
Added new location variables (placeholders) {User}, {Domain} and {UserWithDomain} (same as existing variable {user.name}).
- **Improved**: FileManager load time (especially when using UNC path and impersonation) at first page load. 
RootFolders will all show as expandable except if ListSubfolder permission is denied.
No physical file system check will be done till page loads or user clicks expander icon.
- **Improved**: Made error messages more clear when a folder is not accesible due to permissions or not actually exists.
- **Changed**: Colon (:) character is no more allowed for root folder names.
- **Added**: "Download with chunked transfer threshold" setting on "Application Settings" dialog which should be set only if you have problems downloading large files 
due to your environment limitations (reverse proxy etc.). For example, Microsoft Forefront UAG can not 
parse http reponses when content-length is larger than 2GB (throws HTTP 500 due to 32-bit integer limit) so it should
be set to 2GB for UAG.
- **Improved**: Made all file types open in current window on iOS. Mobile safari is very restrictive with pop-ups and causes
scrolling problems so it's better to open files in the same window to make sure native file viewers (images, PDF, DOC, XLS etc.) work properly.
- **Fixed**: In some cases, lazy thumbnail loading was not initiated on browser resize causing some thumbnails to appear blank.
- **Fixed**: Some vulnerabilities regarding paths. These vulnerabilities were not severe as they required an authenticated user session (not possible anonymously)
and as FileVista's default installation restricts permissions in FileVista folder to prevent these kind of attacks.
- **Added**: ts and m2t extensions for video thumbnails.
- **Fixed**: Too many Failed events were being logged when GetThumbnail action failed.

## Version 6.0.9 - October 11, 2014
- **Fixed**: When pasted items copied or cut from another folder, current folder was not being refreshed.
- **Fixed**: On touch devices, tooltip never disappeared and was not updated when a different item was selected.
- **Improved**: Borders will be shown for focused but unselected items.
- Minor UI improvements.
- **Fixed**: Possible problems when updating from older versions with SQL Server .

## Version 6.0.8 - September 11, 2014
- **Fixed**: In IE11, when downloading files with unicode characters in name, file names were corrupted.

## Version 6.0.7 - June 30, 2014
- **Added**: When the ribbon is unpinned, the ribbon will hide itself after clicking a command just like in Windows Explorer.
- **Fixed**: In IE11, there was another blank page problem. This occured when "Display intranet sites in Compatibility View" option (Tools -> Compatibility View Settings) was checked.
When this option is checked, IE11 renders the page in IE7 mode and FileVista does not support IE7 anymore starting with v6.0.
From now on, FileVista will set "X-UA-Compatible" header to "IE=edge" for all pages so that IE11 is forced to render the pages in Edge/Default mode.
- **Fixed**: On root folder page, when tab button translations were long words (eg. German), the last tab button (File types) was dropping down and thus could not be properly clicked.

## Version 6.0.6 - June 1, 2014
- **Added**: Swedish language.
- **Fixed**: Blank page problem on environments where the url is not allowed to contain parentheses.
  This caused the language file not to be loaded. One example environment is Microsoft UAG which
  did not have ( and ) as legal characters in URL by default so it rejected the language file request.
- **Fixed**: In IE8, ribbon was displayed blank due to "tagName is null or undefined" error when some
  of the buttons were hidden due to permissions. This was not observable when the folder had full permissions.
- **Fixed**: Text wrapping and sizing of ribbon buttons for non-english languages. Also made height of ribbon tabs consistent.
- **Fixed**: License key was not accepted with "Invalid license key" error when FIPSAlgorithmPolicy was enabled in Windows.
  This Windows setting is usually enabled by default especially for government agencies. 

## Version 6.0.5 - May 21, 2014
- **Fixed**: In IE8 and IE9, folder was automatically selected/loaded when right clicked (context menu) in the navigation pane.
- **Fixed**: On iOS, you could not touch and select a folder in the navigation pane.
- **Fixed**: On iOS, drag-selector was not displayed properly (blue borders were separated from the center).
  Also improved the speed of drag-selector on other browsers.
- **Fixed**: On iOS, sometimes image thumbnails were not loaded. This was due to touch scroll not being detected
  and thus lazy-image loading was not activated.
- **Added**: On iOS, "Download" and "Open" commands did not work at all because of the popup blocker.
  Also In IE11, popup blocker was activated on "Open" command.
  To solve the popup blocker problems, added a new file viewer window. When you "Open" a file,
  a new browser window will not be opened anymore, instead the contents will be displayed in this custom window. 
  If the file is an image, then it will be displayed nicely i.e. the image will be centered vertically and horizantally.
  Also on iOS, it is possible to touch scroll this image if it's bigger than the window.
  Note that you are still dependent on the browser for file types that can be displayed. If the browser can not open 
  a file type, then it will prompt for open/download as usual.

## Version 6.0 - May 16, 2014
- Completely redesigned and rewrote the UI to resemble Windows 8 / Windows Server 2012 File Explorer
- **Added**: A ribbon bar with large and small buttons for each command. Ribbon bar can be also collapsed.
- **Added**: A new navigation (folders) pane which is collapsible and removable.
  In collapsed mode, when clicked on title, it can slide-in.
- **Added**: A multi-view which supports 6 different view layouts: 
    Extra large icons, Large icons, Medium icons, Small icons, Details and Tiles
  Details layout is similar to the grid in previous versions but has more features:
    Columns can be moved, resized and removed
    Ability to display thousands of items fast by only rendering items that are visible.
    When there are more than 1000 items in current folder, it's recommended to use this layout as it will not slow down the browser.
  Extra large icons, Large icons, Medium icons and Tiles layouts can display thumbnails.
    Thumbnails are lazy-loaded i.e. the image is requested from the server when the item is first visible so this improves performance when there are lots of images in the folder.
  Added a drag selector to allow easy selection of items which works in all view layouts.
  Added a new tooltip which displays detailed info when you hover on an item.
  Ability to switch between view layouts quickly any time via "Ribbon -> View tab" or via the status bar.
- **Added**: New icons for every file type. 5 different sizes (256, 96, 48, 32 and 16) of each file icon
  is added so that they display perfectly in each view layout.
- **Added**: Image thumbnails will be displayed for these file types:
    "bmp", 
    "gif", 
    "png", 
    "jpg", "jpeg", "jpe", "jif", "jfif", "jfi", "exif", 
    "tif", "tiff", "tff", 
    "psd"
  Even on shared hosting (medium-trust), thumbnails can be generated for all types
  except psd (Photoshop file). Also on medium-trust, thumbnails will be generated
  for gif files but the quality of the thumbnails will be lower.
- **Added**: Video thumbnails will be displayed for these file types:
    "avi", 
    "mp4", "m4v", "mp4v", "3g2", "3gp",
    "mpg", "mpeg", "mpe", "vob",
    "mov", 
    "mkv", 
    "wmv", "asf",
    "m2ts", "mts",
    "flv"
  The duration of the video will also be added as an overlay at the bottom-right of video thumbnails (similar to YouTube).
  This is for giving quick information on how long the video is and 
  also for being able to distinguish between video and image thumbnails at first sight.
  On shared hosting (medium-trust), video thumbnails cannot be generated.
- **Added**: When a thumbnail cannot be generated for a file either due to hosting permissions or file corruption,
  then the icon for that file will displayed. Icons for all file types whether it is thumbnail-able or not are 
  already provided.
- **Added**: Commands in ribbon bar or context menus will be visible only when that folder allows the corresponding permission.
  In previous versions, a disallowed command was greyed-out but still visible. Hiding the disallowed commands completely
  will prevent the confusion of users and allow administrators to see what's allowed or disallowed at first sight.
- **Added**: A status bar (bottom bar) which displays the number of items in current folder and number of selected items.
  When an action (request to server) takes longer time than a certain amount, the spinning busy animation will be also displayed here.
- **Added**: Number formatting according to the current culture. In previous versions, dates were already formatted.
  Now numbers such as file size will also be formatted.
- **Added**: ViewLayout option to "Folder Browsing" tab of "Application Settings" window. The default setting is "Large icons".

## Version 5.3.1 - Feb 7, 2014
- **Improved**: Increased maximum length for user/group names from 30 to 50 characters.

## Version 5.3 - May 21, 2013
- **Improved**: Compatibility with iOS devices. It's now possible to scroll properly by touching and moving on white areas of folder tree and file listing (also on tree views and grid views on administration pages).
With iOS 6, it's now possible to upload files. Selecting multiple files to upload is also possible. Safari mobile renames all selected pictures to "image.jpg" so unique ids will be appended to file names to distinguish files.

## Version 5.2.1 - April 12, 2013
- **Fixed**: Medium-trust (shared hosting) compatibility was broken in v5.2 due to DLL obfuscation.

## Version 5.2 - April 8, 2013
- **Added**: Completely redesigned the upload methods. New upload methods are Html5, Silverlight, Flash, Html4 in priority order. All methods provide accurate progress information.
	Html5: This is the best one as it supports unlimited file size (via chunking), multiple selection at once and drag & drop. This method is available on IE 10 and all other recent browsers.
	You can also drag and drop files from local folders to the upload window with this method.
	Silverlight: This is the second best one as it's similar to Html5 except it does not support drag & drop currently. Silverlight method can be a good alternative when users can not
	upgrade to browsers that support Html5. This method is also good for large files like Html5.
	Flash: This supports multiple selection at once but it does not work well with large files due to problems in Adobe plugin. If you are uploading files larger than few hundred MBs of files, 
	it will probably fail before even starting the upload. Flash plugin loads the whole file into memory which is inefficient and which causes a delay before starting the upload.
	However this method is different than the Flash method in previous versions as it will now retain cookies and authentication headers. This method should be only used
	when uploading small files and multiple selection at once is required.
	Html4: This method works on all browsers. Browser and Ajax methods in previous versions is merged into this method. This method always provides progress information
	even if FileVista is hosted on a shared host (medium-trust) unlike previous Ajax method which required full-trust. This is the only method that chunking the file is not possible
	so there is a maximum limit of 2GB per file imposed by IIS and ASP.NET.
- **Added**: When uploading a file that already exists, "Upload Conflict" dialog will be displayed. The user can either, upload and replace the file, skip the file or upload and keep both files by using an alternative name (eg. file(2).jpg).
It's also possible to "do same for all conflicts" when there are multiple conflicts in the queue.
- **Added**: Permission checks will be done before actually uploading the files and rejected files will be displayed beforehand. User can see the rejection reason by clicking on "Rejected" link in the status column.
- **Added**: When uploading multiple files, the uploader will continue the other files even if a file fails. User can see the error details by clicking on "Failed" link in the status column.
- **Improved**: During uploading, if user tries to navigate away from the page (eg. goes to new url or drops a file into the browser), interrupting will be prevented with a dialog window asking to leave or stay on the page.
- **Improved**: More detailed upload information will be logged in the Events section and will be sent via email notifications. Status for each file such as Rejected, Skipped, Canceled, Failed, Completed and status reasons will be logged.
Also the total uploaded size, elapsed time and transfer rate will be logged.
- **Improved**: Compatibility with IE 10. Bottom of dialog windows were displayed with white background.
- **Improved**: Resources like js and css files will be always gzipped independent of IIS settings for extra performance. File manager page, administration page and all dialog windows will load faster.
- **Improved**: Prevented some unnecessary errors logged in the Events section such as "Only http method POST is accepted" or "The remote host closed the connection". 
First error was caused by Firefox's built-in image viewer sending a second request for the same image or users/search bots trying to open temporary download URL manually. Second error was sometimes caused when users canceled an ongoing download.

## Version 5.0.5 - March 14, 2013
- **Fixed**: On IIS 6 (classic pipeline mode) installations, when Email button was clicked on "Create Public Link" dialog, the inserted public link URL was broken (it did not include the part after question mark).
- **Fixed**: There was an error in French language file (fr.xml) which caused blank login page when this language was selected.
- **Fixed**: When "inherit from parent" checkbox for a subfolder was unchecked, all users would see that subfolder's parent root folder in the folder tree. This was not a security risk as only the name of the root folder was visible but
no further file actions were possible.
- **Fixed**: On some IIS configurations, when "Run FileVista" button was clicked on the installer after a successful installation, invalid URL http://*/FileVista/ was launched instead of http://localhost/FileVista/.

## Version 5.0.1 - February 2, 2013
- **Fixed**: Some broken UI issues on IE7. Empty cells were collapsed when a row was selected in the grid view. Public link address box was collapsed on "Create Public Link" dialog when the URL was too long.
Inherited and explicit user/group entries were shown twice instead of being shown as a single entry on "New/Edit Root Folder" dialog.

## Version 5.0 - January 21, 2013
- **Added**: Completely redesigned the access control system. Permissions can now be set as "Allow" or "Deny" separately just like Windows permissions.
This will allow more flexibility. The hierarchy of precedence for the permissions can be summarized as follows, with the higher precedence permissions listed at the top of the list:
	Explicit Deny
	Explicit Allow
	Inherited Deny
	Inherited Allow
Notifications can be set as "Notify" or "Do not notify" separately just like permissions and follows the same precedence rules.
Restricted file types can be set as "Allow" or "Deny" and follows the same precedence rules.
It's now possible to hide specific subfolders by denying all permissions or removing the user/group entry.
By default subfolders will inherit from parent but it's possible to stop inheritance at any level and add explicit entries.
- **Added**:  Redesigned "Root folder" dialog to reflect the access control changes. Inherited user/group entries will be displayed in grey color for distinguishing them from explicit entries.
Permissions, notifications, quota and file types are separated to their own tabs. Permission set (Full, Read) and notification set (On all) checkboxes will allow easy selection of a group of items.
Added an advanced "file types table" for managing allowed or denied file type patterns easily instead of entering semi-colon separated patterns.
When "Inherit from parent" checkbox is unchecked it will now prompt to add inherited entries as explicit entries or remove them completely.
- **Added**:  Redesigned "Direct Link" feature and renamed it to "Public Link" as it implies the purpose more clearly. Also the link URLs will contain "public" instead of "link" for the handler name.
Old type of links will still work as usual. As soon as "Create Public Link" in the file context menu is clicked, the link will be generated automatically with default options. The link can be deleted/updated on the same dialog.
The links will look "beautiful" as GUIDs will not be used anymore. Instead, the file name will be used along with a number id so that URLs are still not guessable and name collisions do not occur.
By default, paths are not included in links for shorter URLs. However with one click, it's possible to use current folder's path or type a completely different path. Forward slashes can be used for deep paths.
The file name in link can also be changed to a different name. The file extension if any will be automatically appended.
- **Added**: Public links management feature. "Manage Public Links" menu item in the file context menu will allow editing and deleting existing public links for a certain file.
"Manage Public Links" dialog will show a detailed list of public links  with columns such as created by, hit count, last hit time, date created, date modified, expired and hit limit reached. 
This information will allow to locate and delete expired/unnecessary public links or change settings of used public links easily. 
Users will see only the direct links created by them and group managers will only see the direct links created by them or their group members. 
Administrators will see all the public links created for that file regardless of who created them. 
- **Added**: A new section named "Public Links" is added to the administration page to allow Administrators to view and manage all public links at one place. This section will show application-wide public links meaning from all root folders and subfolders.
- **Added**: New email delivery options on "Application Settings" dialog: "Specified pickup directory" and "Pickup directory from IIS". "Specified pickup directory" can be also used to test email notifications feature more easily as
the emails will be delivered/saved to App_Data\Email folder (by default but changable).
- **Improved**: Upload dialog will hide automatically on completion if there is no error and all the uploaded files will be automatically selected in the file listing for easily locating them.
- **Improved**: Many minor issues are fixed and improvements are made.

## Version 4.6.1 - December 4, 2012
- **Fixed**: A vulnerability regarding paths.
- **Fixed**: Editing Administrators group in demo mode was not working properly.
- **Improved**: The fix regarding "large file downloads and memory pressure" first applied in v4.5.10 is now undone as it had a side effect of limiting download speed to 800 kb/s. 
Now the download speed will be restored to the maximum. The actual source of the problem seems to be vanished and this may be related to an IIS hotfix.

## Version 4.6 - May 29, 2012
- **Added**: Touch support (especially for iOS devices iPad and iPhone)
 Context menus will now work by touching and holding on an item.
 Multiple items will be selected one by one or by touching and dragging over the items.
 Rendering is optimized, all UI elements (including pane separator) will work correctly, best possible font will be used. 
 Downloads will work for supported files like image and text files.
 Unfortunately due to restrictions of Safari Mobile Browser on iOS, uploading files will not be possible.
- **Improved**: Precision of context menus. Right-clicking on empty areas will be detected more correctly so the main context menu can be accessed more easily.
- **Fixed**: "Date" column in the event viewer showed date + time where it should only display date portion.
- **Fixed**: There was a problem with direct links when accessed anonymously. It was caused by an error while logging the direct link event. 
 The failure of the event caused the link to work on first hit but fail on subsequent hits by the same browser (cached hits). After this fix, 
 direct link events with "Anonymous User" will be logged correctly and as a result subsequent hits to the direct links will never fail.
- **Fixed**: Leaving SMTP server name empty was causing an application error. This is prevented and a "Failure" event will be logged for SMTP startup errors from now on.
- **Fixed**: Prevented "Attempted to access a path that is not on the disk" error when creating/editing a dynamic root folder with "{user.name}" placeholder in the path. 
Also if a group manager adds a new user, all dynamic root folders of the user will be checked and created if necessary when the new user logs in.
- **Added**: A new smart installer which will configure all aspects of IIS including creating the application pool and setting the necessary permissions.
The installer supports IIS 6 and IIS 7+ natively. It will not require "IIS 6 Metabase Compatibility" feature to be enabled for IIS 7+.
It will warn if IIS 6+ is not installed and install prerequisites like .Net Framework 4.0 automatically if required.
It will allow the user to launch FileVista directly (by detecting web site bindings) after the installation is complete.
The new installer will provide a one-step and hassle-free installation.

## Version 4.5.10 - April 19, 2012
- **Fixed**: Large file downloads (usually files bigger than 1GB) were sometimes interrupted to a memory pressure issue. 
This was experienced usually when the download speed was falling behind the streaming speed which caused internal buffer of IIS to expand constantly. 
With this fix, minimum (none or only few MBs) memory increase should be observed on the server during downloading large files.

## Version 4.5.9 - February 17, 2012
- **Fixed**: The JavaScript error below which occured only on IE 8 (it didn't occur in IE 8 compatibility mode of IE 9):
"HTML Parsing Error: Unable to modify the parent container element before the child element is closed (KB927917)"
- **Fixed**: Incomplete/corrupted downloads problem in zip streaming feature (first introduced in v4.5.0) which occured when downloading large files due to a timeout issue. 
The problem did not occur with single file downloads. Note that zip streaming is active only when multiple items are downloaded or "Download As Zip" action is used explicitly.
Previously suggested web.config workaround (executionTimeout setting) will not be necessary after this fix so it should be removed.
- **Fixed**: Streamed zips (even small ones) could not be opened/unzipped with Archive Utility on Mac, the zip file structure is fixed to be compatible with this utility. 
Note that when the size is larger than 4GB, zip file must be generated in zip64 format instead of the regular format. 
Some older unzippers like Windows XP Explorer and Mac Archive Utility (maybe not newer versions) do not support zip64 format so you may need to use 
a more recent unzipper (Mac Unarchiver, Winzip, Winrar etc.) for files larger than 4GB on these systems.
- **Improved**: Zip files will be generated with no compression (files are stored) during zip streaming so that CPU usage is minimized. 
There are two additional advantages due to this improvement other than server performance. 
First advantage is, we can simulate the zip generation and determine the zip file size exactly (and fast) before streaming.
This was not possible previously so the browser showed indeterminate progress information (chunked transfer encoding) during download due to lack of knowing the final file size.
So now the browser will show the exact zip file size on its "Open/Save As" dialog immediately after user clicks "Download As Zip" and 
it will show a determinate progress information on "Downloading" dialog. In short, zip streaming will behave exactly like single file downloads.
Second advantage is, the users will be able to extract the received zip file very fast as there is no compression. This would be helpful when downloading large files and folders.
Users who want to actually compress files should use "Add To Zip" action instead of "Download As Zip" and then download the generated zip file.
- **Fixed**: Some unnecessary errors were being recorded in the event log when the download was interrupted mostly due to user cancelling the download.
- **Improved**: On Upload dialog, Ajax and Flash menu items will be disabled on the main context menu's submenu "Upload Method" when these methods are not available to prevent confusion for the user.
Flash menu item will be disabled when Adobe Flash Player is not found or enabled in the browser. Also "Add" button will be enabled only when Flash object is loaded completely to prevent user clicking
the button too early. Ajax menu item will be disabled when the application is running on ASP.NET medium trust which does not allow Ajax upload method. Note that these upload methods were already disabled 
and degraded to the next best method when not available. This improvement is only for UI to report the available upload methods to the user correctly.
- **Improved**: For security reasons, maxAllowedContentLength and maxRequestLength settings will be increased to 2GB only for the upload handler in "FileUltimate/Web.config" file. 
The default IIS and ASP.NET limits is sufficient for other handlers so keeping them at default values will protect against DoS attacks. 
- **Changed**: Renamed resource folders under App_GlobalResources from FileUltimate and FileVista to FileUltimateResourceStore and FileVistaResourceStore.

## Version 4.5.1 - January 31, 2012
- **Fixed**: Root folders were not being sorted in alphabetical order as in versions before v4.5.
- **Fixed**: The below error that may occur when trying to download a file which was opened in some rare applications which locks the file in write-only mode:
"The process cannot access the file ‘file name' because it is being used by another process"

## Version 4.5 (Quick Fixes)
- Fixed (4.5.0.1): The error "The SqlParameter is already contained by another SqlParameterCollection" while upgrading a previous SQL Server database to v4.5.
The error also occured after a clean install of v4.5 using a SQL Server database but this time on the "License Information" or "Application Settings" dialogs.
- Fixed (4.5.0.2): Some JavaScript files were not minified. Also the CSS files are minified now.

## Version 4.5 - January 12, 2012
- This release is focused on improving the infrastucture rather than adding new features. This will allow adding new features more quickly in the next releases.
- Almost rewritten both client-side and serder-side code for maximum performance and stability.
Client-server communication will be done via JSON instead of XML for improving performance on both the client and server.
Browsing huge folders/administration sections is vastly improved (thousands of items will be displayed very quickly). 
This is both done with optimizations in server code and with Browser rendering optimizations in client code.
All pages are updated use HTML5 markup and scripts & css are combined into single file per page for improving loading speed.
- Completely new UI with Windows 7 look and feel. All UI icons are updated.
All file type icons are updated and lots of new ones are added.
- Almost rewritten upload feature. UI of upload dialog is vastly improved.
Even with the basic upload method (browser upload), detailed progress information will be shown.
Files added in the upload dialog will be processed one by one for better performance and statistics.
One other advantage of this change is that 2GB upload limit will effect files individually so there will be no limit for the total size of the files added in the upload dialog.
It's also now possible to change upload method on the fly via context menu on the upload dialog.
This is useful if users experience problems on certain platforms (especially with Flash upload).
- **Improved**: Dropped support for IE 6. Minimum required version for Internet Explorer is now 7. Optimized performance for new generation of browsers like IE 9+, Firefox 5+, Chrome 12+ and Safari 5+. 
Older versions of browsers are still supported.
- **Improved**: "Download As Zip" action now directly streams the zip file that is being generated to the client. 
So the user will not have to wait for the whole compressing to complete before downloading. The user will see browser's "Open / Save As" dialog immediately and receive the file on the fly as it is being generated.
No zip files will be created in the Temporary folder.
- **Added**: Application specific errors (in addition to file manager action errors) will also be logged to Events section for better troubleshooting.

## Version 4.1 (Quick Fixes)
- **Fixed**: Execution timeout setting was broken in the download module and causing the downloads to be interrupted after ASP.NET's default timeout value 110 seconds.
- **Fixed**: The title of the folder tree was displaying "Folders" instead of "Administration" in the administration page.
- **Fixed**: The root folder edit form will not be emptied upon submit if the path does not exist and it can not be created.
- **Fixed**: Js errors in IE when closing some modal dialogs (started to occur in v4.1 due to some changes in page load handling).
- **Fixed**: A user with multiple group memberships could not be deleted by the administrator whereas this restriction was put only for the group managers in the first place.

## Version 4.1 - November 8, 2010
- Integrated FileUltimate v2.1 which features single DLL deployment and many performance improvements.
- All resources and code are embedded into the single file GleamTech.FileVista.dll for better version control of the application.
- FileVista now targets .Net framework 4.0. This means your server/hosting account should run ASP.NET 4.0. Older framework versions will not be supported from this version on.
- **Added**: DLL embedded resources such as CSS files and language files can be overridden by simply putting customized versions to the corresponding folders under 
App_GlobalResources\GleamTech.FileUltimate and App_GlobalResources\GleamTech.FileVista
- **Fixed**: During flash upload, session cookie was sent in the querystring to prevent a bug of Flash plugin in non-IE browsers.
However, cookies such as pass-through cookie, remember-me cookie and other server specific (eg. load-balancing) cookies were not handled thus caused problems when using flash upload method.
Now all existing cookies will be sent in the querystring to make sure flash upload does not fail.
- **Changed**: Creating direct links is now controlled with the new "Direct Link" permission instead of "Download" permission.
- **Added**: New setting for overriding base url (protocol, hostname and port) which is used when creating direct links. If not overridden, user's currently connected base url will be used just like the previous default behaviour.
- **Fixed**: When creating direct links within dynamic root folders (ie. root folders which include {user.name} placeholder in path), the path was not resolved correctly thus "resource not found" error was being generated.
- **Added**: New RecoveryMode setting to filevista.config for resetting administrator password. When set to 1, user will be able to login by just entering the administrator name only.
Then user will be prompted to change/reset his password. The setting will be set back to 0 automatically for security purposes after login.
- **Added**: A group manager will not be able to override quota and allowed file type settings if the administrator restricts these settings for the group on the root folder.
- **Added**: A new group setting to limit the number of members of the group. If the limit is reached, group managers will not be able to add more users to the group.

## Version 4.0 (Quick Fixes)
- **Fixed**: Changed assembly name of VistaDB from strong name (GAC name) to short name in license.licx for preventing compilation errors occured in source code package.
- **Fixed**: Infinite redirection problem (caused by unqualified redirect targets) which occured in directlink handler under ASP.NET 4.0.
- **Fixed**: Added <httpErrors existingResponse="PassThrough" /> setting to web.config for preventing IIS 7 from taking over error messages (friendly 403 and 404 messages) displayed by the direct link page.
- **Fixed**: FileVista will detect if it's running under IIS6 (Classic pipeline mode) and use "link.ashx" in URL (with an extension) for the direct links. 
When running under IIS7 (Integrated pipeline mode), it will use "link" in URL (extension-less) for the direct links.
- **Fixed**: The integrated mode checking done (HttpRunTime.UsingIntegratedPipeline) in previous fix broke compatibility with ASP.NET versions before 2.0 SP2 (2.0.50727.3053 - installed with 3.5 SP1 - release date 2009-01-16).
Now the missing runtime method is checked with reflection to prevent the JIT error which can not be caught with the simple try-catch block .
- **Fixed**: When upgrading to 4.0 from Access database installation, events with Description (Memo field) length more than 3000 characters caused error.
- **Fixed**: Limited event Description field to 3000 in code to match the field size in the database.
- **Fixed**: Increased download buffer size from 8KB to 80KB and removed some unnecessary code from download module to improve download speed.

## Version 4.0 - June 15, 2010
- **Added**: Free license is now available and Trial license now allows upto 5 users. There are three possible license modes: Free (allows 1 user), Trial (allows 5 users but expires in 30 days) and Purchased (allows users according to the license you purchase).
- **Added**: FileVista will be able to run under ASP.NET "Medium" trust level from now on. Many shared-hosting companies (eg. GoDaddy) force Medium trust level on their servers for security reasons and FileVista will be compatible with them now.
- **Added**: Dropped the default Microsoft Access database in favor of a 3rd party compact database engine VistaDB for being able to run under Medium-Trust and 64 bit operating systems.
SQL Server is still supported. Actually, any database engine which provides a SQL Server compatible DbProviderFactory library will be supported.
- **Added**: A third upload method and optimized existing upload methods. Renamed the old upload method "Browser" to "Ajax" and the new upload method to "Browser". New "Browser" method will allow uploading even in medium-trust level by sacrificing the realtime progress information.
"Ajax" method (formerly "Browser") still needs higher permissions due to displaying the realtime progress information so it will not be available in medium-trust level.
Note that the best possible upload method "Flash" will now work in medium-trust level.
- **Added**: Email notifications feature. It's now possible to send automatic email notifications for the following events: Failure, Browse, Create, Delete, Rename, Copy, Move, Compress, Extract, Upload and Download.
The notifications can be set for users and groups on subfolder level just like permissions on the root folder properties page. For instance, if someone uploads to a specific folder, the people in the notification list of that
folder will be notified via email about the upload. Details such as uploaded file names will be also included in the notification email.
- **Added**: New setting "Show system type descriptions" for forcing to show file and folder type descriptions from the system's registry.
If not enabled (default behaviour), then simple (but current language dependant) type descriptions (eg. EXE File) will be shown.
Under Medium-Trust, registry access will not be possible so even if this setting is enabled, simple type descriptions will be shown.
- **Added**: "Direct Link" feature with advanced options. "Direct Link" feature will allow you to reference files within FileVista folders via permanent URLs.
This way you can reference the files in other systems, in documents or in emails.
When creating a direct link, it is possible to set a expiration time, a maximum download limit and a password.
You also have the option to use a custom file name (eg. SomeDocument.pdf) in the direct link URL (for the sake of user friendliness) instead of an automatically generated name (eg. 34817ed6802e4a42aa11527e5d7230fb.pdf).
One other option to specify is forcing download or opening the file directly in browser (for displaying PDF, Word, Excel, Image etc files inline in browser)
- **Added**: New "Application Settings" dialog with tabs.
- **Fixed**: Refresh problem which occured only when you paste after entering into the subfolder.
- **Changed**: All user changeable settings in filevista.config are moved to "Application Settings" dialog for convenience.
- **Changed**: Used tabs for permissions and notifications options on the root folder properties dialog.
- **Changed**: Notification emails are sent asynchronously for better performance.
- Changes: Removed "User Settings" icon from toolbar and made user name which is displayed on the top right of the toolbar, clickable to open "User Settings"dialog.
- **Changed**: Added and changed some language strings in the language files with key numbers 665-723 and 612-613.

## Version 3.8 (Quick Fixes)
- **Fixed**: Firefox 3.6 context menu event handling problem.
- **Fixed**: ModalDialog JS error (parent not set) in IE 8 Compatibility View / IE 7 on the administration page.

## Version 3.8 - March 31, 2010
- **Added**: Spanish and Catalan language files.
- **Added**: Downloading files larger than 2 GB is now possible.
- **Added**: New setting "MaxZipFileSize" in filevista.config for limiting the size of the generated zip files on "Add to Zip" and "Download as Zip" actions. 
If this setting is not set, then there will be no size limit for the zip files just like the previous behaviour.
- **Added**: Detailed information (action size, remaining size and total quota) will be displayed when an action (Upload, Add to Zip, Extract and Paste) exceeds the quota limit of the folder.
- **Added**: New setting "ShowHiddenFilesAndFolders" in filevista.config for forcing to show hidden files and folders.
- **Added**: New setting "ShowSystemFilesAndFolders" in filevista.config for forcing to show system files and folders.
- **Added**: New setting "ShowFileExtensions" in filevista.config for forcing to show the extension part of the file names. When this setting is enabled, the extensions will be shown and editable in the prompt dialog boxes too.
For instance, on "Rename" and "Add to Zip" actions, changing the extension part is possible. The actions will fail if the new extension does not match the allowed types of the folder.
- **Added**: Detailed information (file name, allowed file types) will be displayed when the result of an action (Rename, Add to Zip, Upload) does not match the allowed file types of the folder.
- **Added**: Context menus for the folder tree. It is now possible to do all actions by right clicking a folder in the tree.
- **Added**: Context menus for the folder tree in the administration page.
- **Added**: Language selection is now possible on the login page. The selected language will be saved as the user's culture setting upon successful login.
- **Improved**: Context menu for container folder will be opened when right-clicked on an empty area in the file listing. When right-clicked on the text (name or other properties) of an item row in the file listing, the item will be selected and context menu for the item will be opened.
Removed "Tasks" link above the file listing as it's replaced with the context menu. These improvements are also done in the administration page.
- **Improved**: Mouse cursor will be shown as the pointer (hand) only when on a folder in the folder tree and not on the file listing or the toolbar buttons for a more standard UI.
- **Improved**: Selected item name will be used as the zip file name instead of the generated names like "download-XXXX.zip" when downloading as zip.
- **Improved**: Full name of the user will be displayed in the upper right corner. 
If full name is not available user (account) name will be displayed just like the previous behaviour.
- **Fixed**: Download corruption with some files types like PDF when IIS dynamic compression is enabled.
- **Fixed**: A confirm dialog box will be displayed when downloading as zip. This will prevent IE from showing the information bar and blocking the download.
- **Fixed**: Adding files with the same names will not be allowed in the upload dialog.
- **Fixed**: Add to Zip, Download, Cut and Copy actions will now also depend on Traverse and List permissions of the subfolders. These actions may access the contents of a subfolder so they should be checked against Traverse and List permissions.
- **Fixed**: Quota limit will be checked before starting the actions (Add to Zip, Extract and Paste). If the total size of the action exceeds the quota limit, the action will be canceled.
This will prevent the action from being completed partially. In previous versions, the action was being processed until a file's size exceeded the quota limit. This was causing partially extracted/pasted files.
- **Fixed**: Quota limit will not be checked when moving items from a subfolder to a parent folder and vice versa unless the subfolder has an overridden quota setting.
A parent folder's total size already includes the size of the subfolders so moving items within the parent folder can not effect the remaining quota size.
- **Fixed**: An extension in allowed file types such as "*.jpg", was matching all extensions starting with "jpg" ("*.jpg1", "*.jpga" etc.) where it should match only "*.jpg"
- **Fixed**: Right-clicking (or CTRL + click) now opens the context menu in Firefox Mac. On Mac, Command + click will now allow multiple selection instead of CTRL + click as on Windows.
- **Changed**: In Settings and User Settings pages, only cultures which have a corresponding language file will be displayed in the dropdown box.
- **Changed**: Added some language strings to the language files with key numbers 661-664 and 304-305.

## Version 3.6 - June 5, 2009
- **Fixed**: Added the forgotton 3 new strings to the language files.
- **Fixed**: When a user's password expires and "user cannot change password" option is active, the user will not be allowed to change the password upon login.
- **Fixed**: Optimized the clickable area of the Add button in browser mode for cross-browser compability.
- **Fixed**: Upload dialog missing progress indication in Firefox 2.
- **Added**: Hidden and system files/folders are filtered by default.
- **Added**: 5 new upload related strings to the language files.
- **Added**: French and Arabic language files.
- **Improved**: Speed of file listing in the folder view and subfolder populating in the folder tree.
- **Added**: New setting "DisableFolderExpandableCheck" in filevista.config which can be set to "1" if you are experiencing slow load times with huge folders.
When building the folder tree, FileVista calculates if a folder is expandable or not (ie. if it should have a plus sign or not).
By changing this setting to "1", you can disable this calculation and improve loading speed of huge folders.
- **Fixed**: If a root folder is inaccessible due to insufficient permissions or other problems, it will still be displayed in the folder tree. This will allow to ignore the root folder with problems and continue loading other available root folders in the list.
- **Fixed**: Copying or moving a folder into its subfolder will not be allowed.
- **Added**: Extensions of file names are hidden in the file listing.
- **Fixed**: "Any type" option for allowed file types of a folder, will now allow files without extensions too.
- **Added**: When List permission is denied on a folder, an empty folder will be displayed instead of an error message so that other permitted actions can be still done in the folder. This way "blind uploads" and "traversing subfolders without showing files" will be possible.
- **Added**: A root folder's "allowed file types" setting will now restrict all file actions (List, Delete, Rename, Copy, Move, Extract, Compress and Download) and not only Upload action. This means only allowed file types will be visible and manageable in the file listing.
- **Added**: Edit permission now controls overwriting of existing files during Extract action and editing of an existing zip file during Add to Zip action.
- **Fixed**: Folder tree will be refreshed properly on Cut and Paste of folders.

## Version 3.5 - October 31, 2008
- **Added**: Access control for each user will now also include the "Allowed file types" entry along with Permissions and Quota. This setting currently effects the file names/types/extensions that are allowed to be uploaded to a specific folder by the user.
- **Added**: Advanced security system which allows assigning access control (permissions, quota and allowed file types) for each subfolder of a root folder separately.
Unlike previous versions, subfolders are not forced to inherit and can override the access control of their parent root folder.
- **Changed**: Redesigned root folder edit page for implementing the above features. There are also some small improvements: Last member will be selected when a new user or group added to the allowed list and member will be added with full permissions by default.
- **Added**: Multiple administrators feature. Making a user member of the new system group "Administrators" will make him an administrator.
- **Improved**: Flash upload compatibility with Adobe's latest flash player version 10.0.12.36.
- **Added**: New setting "TemporaryFolder" in filevista.config with the default value of "~/App_Data/temporary". This overridable setting will control the location of the temporary files that are created during actions like "Download As Zip".
- **Fixed**: Text could not be selected in the prompt dialog on IE.
- **Improved**: Enter and Esc keys now work same as the OK and Cancel buttons in the prompt dialog.
- **Fixed**: A warning message will be displayed on Paste, Compress, Extract All actions when the folder reachs its quota limit.

- **Fixed**: Made flash upload mode display detailed errors and log group upload progress correctly.
- **Fixed**: Session will be kept alive in flash upload mode for allowing long time taking files in an upload group and preventing session expiration on first request after the upload finishes.

## Version 3.2.2 - July 4, 2008
- **Fixed**: "Invalid user name or password!" error message was not being displayed and user was not being locked out after reaching "Maximum invalid login attempts".
- **Fixed**: Upload problem which occured in Flash upload mode when uploading more than one file at once. The error was occuring when one of the files took long time to finish, causing a timeout and stopping the overall upload with an error message.

## Version 3.2 - June 19, 2008 
- **Added**: Cookie login pass-through for allowing an external application's authenticated user automatically log in.
- **Added**: "Remember me" option on login page.
